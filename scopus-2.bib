	abstract = {Frailty is an age-related clinical condition characterised by an increased susceptibility to stressors and an elevated risk of adverse outcomes such as mortality. In the light of global population ageing, the prevalence of frailty is expected to soar in coming decades. This narrative review provides critical insights into recent developments and emerging practices in frailty research regarding identification, management, risk factors, and prevention. We searched journals in the top two quartiles of geriatrics and gerontology (from Clarivate Journal Citation Reports) for articles published between 01 January 2018 and 20 December 2022. Several recent developments were identified, including new biomarkers and biomarker panels for frailty screening and diagnosis, using artificial intelligence to identify frailty, and investigating the altered response to medications by older adults with frailty. Other areas with novel developments included exercise (including technology-based exercise), multidimensional interventions, person-centred and integrated care, assistive technologies, analysis of frailty transitions, risk-factors, clinical guidelines, COVID-19, and potential future treatments. This review identified a strong need for the implementation and evaluation of cost-effective, community-based interventions to manage and prevent frailty. Our findings highlight the need to better identify and support older adults with frailty and involve those with frailty in shared decision-making regarding their care. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Worldwide stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of death and disability combined. The estimated global economic burden by stroke is over US$891 billion per year. Within three decades (1990–2019), the incidence increased by 70%, deaths by 43%, prevalence by 102%, and DALYs by 143%. Of over 100 million people affected by stroke, about 76% are ischemic stroke (IS) patients recorded worldwide. Contextually, ischemic stroke moves into particular focus of multi-professional groups including researchers, healthcare industry, economists, and policy-makers. Risk factors of ischemic stroke demonstrate sufficient space for cost-effective prevention interventions in primary (suboptimal health) and secondary (clinically manifested collateral disorders contributing to stroke risks) care. These risks are interrelated. For example, sedentary lifestyle and toxic environment both cause mitochondrial stress, systemic low-grade inflammation and accelerated ageing; inflammageing is a low-grade inflammation associated with accelerated ageing and poor stroke outcomes. Stress overload, decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics and hypomagnesaemia are associated with systemic vasospasm and ischemic lesions in heart and brain of all age groups including teenagers. Imbalanced dietary patterns poor in folate but rich in red and processed meat, refined grains, and sugary beverages are associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia, systemic inflammation, small vessel disease, and increased IS risks. Ongoing 3PM research towards vulnerable groups in the population promoted by the European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) demonstrates promising results for the holistic patient-friendly non-invasive approach utilising tear fluid-based health risk assessment, mitochondria as a vital biosensor and AI-based multi-professional data interpretation as reported here by the EPMA expert group. Collected data demonstrate that IS-relevant risks and corresponding molecular pathways are interrelated. For examples, there is an evident overlap between molecular patterns involved in IS and diabetic retinopathy as an early indicator of IS risk in diabetic patients. Just to exemplify some of them such as the 5-aminolevulinic acid/pathway, which are also characteristic for an altered mitophagy patterns, insomnia, stress regulation and modulation of microbiota-gut-brain crosstalk. Further, ceramides are considered mediators of oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiometabolic disease, negatively affecting mitochondrial respiratory chain function and fission/fusion activity, altered sleep–wake behaviour, vascular stiffness and remodelling. Xanthine/pathway regulation is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and stress-driven anxiety-like behaviour as well as molecular mechanisms of arterial stiffness. In order to assess individual health risks, an application of machine learning (AI tool) is essential for an accurate data interpretation performed by the multiparametric analysis. Aspects presented in the paper include the needs of young populations and elderly, personalised risk assessment in primary and secondary care, cost-efficacy, application of innovative technologies and screening programmes, advanced education measures for professionals and general population—all are essential pillars for the paradigm change from reactive medical services to 3PM in the overall IS management promoted by the EPMA. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: The Ambient Intelligent Geriatric Management (AmbIGeM) system combines wearable sensors with artificial intelligence to trigger alerts to hospital staff before a fall. A clinical trial found no effect across a heterogenous population, but reported a reduction in the injurious falls rate in a post hoc analysis of patients on Geriatric Evaluation Management Unit (GEMU) wards. Cost-effectiveness and Value of Information (VoI) analyses of the AmbIGeM system in GEMU wards was undertaken. Methods: An Australian health-care system perspective and 5-year time horizon were used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Implementation costs, inpatient costs and falls data were collected. Injurious falls were defined as causing bruising, laceration, fracture, loss of consciousness, or if the patient reported persistent pain. To compare costs and outcomes, generalised linear regression models were used to adjust for baseline differences between the intervention and usual care groups. Bootstrapping was used to represent uncertainty. For the VoI analysis, 10,000 different sample sizes with randomly sampled values ranging from 1 to 50,000 were tested to estimate the optimal sample size of a new trial that maximised the Expected Net Benefits of Sampling. Results: An adjusted 0.036 fewer injurious falls (adjusted rate ratio of 0.56) and AUD$4554 lower costs were seen in the intervention group. However, uncertainty that the intervention is cost effective for the prevention of an injurious fall was present at all monetary values of this effectiveness outcome. A new trial with a sample of 4376 patients was estimated to maximise the Expected Net Benefit of Sampling, generating a net benefit of AUD$186,632 at a benefit-to-cost ratio of 1.1. Conclusions: The benefits to cost ratio suggests that a new trial of the AmbIGeM system in GEMU wards may not be high-value compared to other potential trials, and that the system should be implemented. However, a broader analysis of options for preventing falls in GEMU is required to fully inform decision making.

	abstract = {Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in modern intensive care units (ICU). Due to accurate and early warning, the in-time antibiotic treatment of sepsis is critical for improving sepsis outcomes, contributing to saving lives, and reducing medical costs. However, the earlier prediction of sepsis onset is made, the fewer monitoring measurements can be processed, causing a lower prediction accuracy. In contrast, a more accurate prediction can be expected by analyzing more data but leading to the delayed warning associated with life-threatening events. In this study, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for solving early prediction of sepsis, called the Policy Network-based Early Warning Monitoring System (PoEMS). The proposed PoEMS provides accurate and early prediction results for sepsis onset based on analyzing varied-length electronic medical records (EMR). Furthermore, the system serves by monitoring the patient's health status consistently and provides an early warning only when a high risk of sepsis is detected. Additionally, a controlling parameter is designed for users to adjust the trade-off between earliness and accuracy, providing the adaptability of the model to meet various medical requirements in practical scenarios. Through a series of experiments on real-world medical data, the results demonstrate that our proposed PoEMS achieves a high AUROC result of more than 91% for early prediction, and predicts sepsis onset earlier and more accurately compared to other state-of-the-art competing methods.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The researchers extracted key terms from these guidelines and categorized them based on their frequency across the six sources to get a deeper understanding of their content and identify central themes and topics across each guideline. In doing so, the paper was able to identify ethical considerations and challenges of implementing AI in the Philippine context, including data collection, use and sharing, and AI development. The insights from the literature and document reviews and the analysis of the extracted key terms were used to craft considerations in formulating AI policy for the Philippines. These include (1) defining ethical principles and values in developing and implementing AI, (2) establishing mechanisms for ensuring fairness and preventing bias, (3) implementing mechanisms to ensure security and mitigating risks in AI systems, and (4) assessing potential impacts on AI technologies. Overall, the study uncovered that existing guidelines and legal frameworks on AI ethics seem to have put less emphasis on ethics and fairness. This underpins the need for the PH to ensure that its localized AI ethics policy is clear about its definition of what is ethical and fair use of AI across sectors, industries., demographics, and contexts.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Vascular specialists remain in high demand in current practice and commonly oversee care delivery for a variety of clinical emergencies. Accordingly, the contemporary vascular surgeon must be facile with treating a spectrum of problems, including a complex, heterogeneous group of acute arteriovenous thromboembolic and bleeding diatheses. It has been documented previously that there are substantial current workforce limitations placing constraints on vascular surgical care provision. Moreover, with the aging at-risk population, there remains a considerable national urgency to improve timely diagnoses, specialty consultation, and appropriate transfer of patients to centers of excellence capable of providing a comprehensive compendium of emergency vascular services. Clinical decision aids, simulation training, and regionalization of nonelective vascular problems are all strategies that have been increasingly recognized to address these service gaps. Notably, clinical research in vascular surgery has traditionally focused on identification of patient- and procedure-related factors that influence outcomes by using resource-intensive causal inference methodology. By comparison, large data sets have only more recently been recognized to be a valuable tool that can provide heuristic algorithms to address more complex health care problems. Such data can be manipulated to generate clinical risk scores and decision aids, as well as robust outcome descriptions, which stand to inform stakeholders regarding best practice. The purpose of this review was to provide a robust overview of the lessons derived from the application of big data, risk prediction, and simulation in the management of vascular emergencies. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {With the advances in technology and data science, machine learning (ML) is being rapidly adopted by the health care sector. However, there is a lack of literature addressing the health conditions targeted by the ML prediction models within primary health care (PHC) to date. To fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines to identify health conditions targeted by ML in PHC. We searched the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Elsevier, BioRxiv, Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and IEEE Xplore databases for studies published from January 1990 to January 2022. We included primary studies addressing ML diagnostic or prognostic predictive models that were supplied completely or partially by real-world PHC data. Studies selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using the prediction model study risk of bias assessment tool were performed by two investigators. Health conditions were categorized according to international classification of diseases (ICD-10). Extracted data were analyzed quantitatively. We identified 106 studies investigating 42 health conditions. These studies included 207 ML prediction models supplied by the PHC data of 24.2 million participants from 19 countries. We found that 92.4% of the studies were retrospective and 77.3% of the studies reported diagnostic predictive ML models. A majority (76.4%) of all the studies were for models’ development without conducting external validation. Risk of bias assessment revealed that 90.8% of the studies were of high or unclear risk of bias. The most frequently reported health conditions were diabetes mellitus (19.8%) and Alzheimer’s disease (11.3%). Our study provides a summary on the presently available ML prediction models within PHC. We draw the attention of digital health policy makers, ML models developer, and health care professionals for more future interdisciplinary research collaboration in this regard.

	abstract = {Scholars, policymakers and organizations in the EU, especially at the level of the European Commission, have turned their attention to the ethics of (trustworthy and human-centric) Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there has been little reflexivity on (1) the history of the ethics of AI as an institutionalized phenomenon and (2) the comparison to similar episodes of “ethification” in other fields, to highlight common (unresolved) challenges. Contrary to some mainstream narratives, which stress how the increasing attention to ethical aspects of AI is due to the fast pace and increasing risks of technological developments, Science and Technology Studies(STS)-informed perspectives highlight that the rise of institutionalized assessment methods indicates a need for governments to gain more control of scientific research and to bring EU institutions closer to the public on controversies related to emerging technologies. This article analyzes how different approaches of the recent past (i.e. bioethics, technology assessment (TA) and ethical, legal and social (ELS) research, Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)) followed one another, often “in the name of ethics”, to address previous criticisms and/or to legitimate certain scientific and technological research programs. The focus is on how a brief history of the institutionalization of these approaches can provide insights into present challenges to the ethics of AI related to methodological issues, mobilization of expertise and public participation. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Current constrained reinforcement learning (RL) methods guarantee constraint satisfaction only in expectation, which is inadequate for safety-critical decision problems. Since a constraint satisfied in expectation remains a high probability of exceeding the cost threshold, solving constrained RL problems with high probabilities of satisfaction is critical for RL safety. In this work, we consider the safety criterion as a constraint on the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of cumulative costs, and propose the CVaR-constrained policy optimization algorithm (CVaR-CPO) to maximize the expected return while ensuring agents pay attention to the upper tail of constraint costs. According to the bound on the CVaR-related performance between two policies, we first reformulate the CVaR-constrained problem in augmented state space using the state extension procedure and the trust-region method. CVaR-CPO then derives the optimal update policy by applying the Lagrangian method to the constrained optimization problem. In addition, CVaR-CPO utilizes the distribution of constraint costs to provide an efficient quantile-based estimation of the CVaR-related value function. We conduct experiments on constrained control tasks to show that the proposed method can produce behaviors that satisfy safety constraints, and achieve comparable performance to most safe RL (SRL) methods.

	abstract = {In recent years, rapid technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have brought significant transformations across various industries and sectors. These advancements have created unprecedented opportunities for leveraging data-driven insights and informed decision-making. Urban populations swiftly adopt information technology solutions to monitor and regulate noise levels and environmental pollutants effectively. This research aims to bridge the traditional gap between environmental science and economics by harnessing cutting-edge AI and IoT technologies. Support vector machine (SVM) is a robust machine learning algorithm known for its ability to decipher complex, non-linear relationships within large and intricate datasets. This study constructs a robust simultaneous equation model by integrating economic indicators, real-time IoT sensor data, and relevant covariates. Mitigate the health risks associated with air pollution and raise awareness of its detrimental impacts. Air pollution continues to pose challenges to intelligent and sustainable healthcare systems. The healthcare ecosystem, coupled with various machine learning techniques, seeks to mitigate pollution’s impact and enhance residents’ quality of life by offering intelligent services. The analysis of the reciprocal relationship and impact mechanisms between economic development and air pollution is substantiated by empirical data. Formulates an air pollution index using principal component analysis but also develops simultaneous equations that account for spatial effects, urban panel data, and interactions between economic development and air pollution. The experimental results highlight the efficacy of the proposed SVM, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 84.5%. This performance outstrips alternative methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost algorithms, reaffirming SVM’s prowess in accurately modeling the intricate relationship between economic development and air pollution, particularly when utilizing IoT data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of the One Health (OH) approach, which considers the health of humans, animals, and the environment in preventing future pandemics. A wide range of sustainable interdisciplinary collaborations are required to truly fulfill the purpose of the OH approach. It is well-recognized, however, that such collaborations are challenging. In this study, we undertook key-informant interviews with a panel of stakeholders from Japan to identify their perceived needs and challenges related to OH research. This panel included scientists, government officials, journalists, and industry stakeholders. By combining a thematic analysis of these interviews and a literature review, we summarized two key themes pertinent to the effective implementation of OH research: types of required research and systems to support that research. As a technological issue, interviewees suggested the importance of research and development of methodologies that can promote the integration and collaboration of research fields that are currently fragmented. An example of such a methodology would allow researchers to obtain high-resolution metadata (e.g. ecological and wildlife data) with high throughput and then maximize the use of the obtained metadata in research, such as in environmental DNA analysis, database construction, or the use of computational algorithms to find novel viral genomes. In terms of systems surrounding OH research, some interviewees stressed the importance of creating a sustainable research system, such as one that has continuous budget support and allows researchers to pursue their academic careers and interests. These perceptions and challenges held by Japanese stakeholders may be common to others around the world. We hope this review will encourage more researchers and others to work together to create a resilient society against future pandemics. © 2022 The Authors},

This has translated into the proliferation of research outputs, such as from Explainable AI, to enhance transparency and control for system debugging and monitoring, and intelligibility of system process and output for user services. Yet, such outputs are difficult to adopt on a practical level due to a lack of a common regulatory baseline, and the contextual nature of explanations. Governmental policies are now attempting to tackle such exigence, however it remains unclear to what extent published communications, regulations, and standards adopt an informed perspective to support research, industry, and civil interests. In this study, we perform the first thematic and gap analysis of this plethora of policies and standards on explainability in the EU, US, and UK. Through a rigorous survey of policy documents, we first contribute an overview of governmental regulatory trajectories within AI explainability and its sociotechnical impacts. We find that policies are often informed by coarse notions and requirements for explanations. This might be due to the willingness to conciliate explanations foremost as a risk management tool for AI oversight, but also due to the lack of a consensus on what constitutes a valid algorithmic explanation, and how feasible the implementation and deployment of such explanations are across stakeholders of an organization. Informed by AI explainability research, we then conduct a gap analysis of existing policies, which leads us to formulate a set of recommendations on how to address explainability in regulations for AI systems, especially discussing the definition, feasibility, and usability of explanations, as well as allocating accountability to explanation providers. © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Natural language processing—the branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and human language—has advanced markedly in recent years with the introduction of sophisticated deep-learning models. Improved performance in natural language processing tasks, such as text and speech processing, have fueled impressive demonstrations of these models’ capabilities. Perhaps no demonstration has been more impactful to date than the introduction of the publicly available online chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI, which is based on a natural language processing model known as a Generative Pretrained Transformer. Through a series of questions posed by the authors about obstetrics and gynecology to ChatGPT as prompts, we evaluated the model's ability to handle clinical-related queries. Its answers demonstrated that in its current form, ChatGPT can be valuable for users who want preliminary information about virtually any topic in the field. Because its educational role is still being defined, we must recognize its limitations. Although answers were generally eloquent, informed, and lacked a significant degree of mistakes or misinformation, we also observed evidence of its weaknesses. A significant drawback is that the data on which the model has been trained are apparently not readily updated. The specific model that was assessed here, seems to not reliably (if at all) source data from after 2021. Users of ChatGPT who expect data to be more up to date need to be aware of this drawback. An inability to cite sources or to truly understand what the user is asking suggests that it has the capability to mislead. Responsible use of models like ChatGPT will be important for ensuring that they work to help but not harm users seeking information on obstetrics and gynecology. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The Western Pacific region is a diverse region experiencing fast economic growth and nutrition transition. We systematically examined 94 cohort studies on the associations of dietary and other lifestyle factors on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the region. These studies were mainly from China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore. Patterns and changes in lifestyle risk factors for NCDs based on national surveys were examined. They showed some dietary intake improvements over the past three decades, featured as increased consumption of unsaturated oils, fruits, and vegetables, and decreased consumption of sodium and unhealthy fat. Despite a decrease in smoking rate and salt intake, the values remained higher than the global levels in 2019. The ultra-processed food intake in the region increased at a higher rate than the global estimate. National guidelines relevant to NCDs in five selected countries were highlighted. Strong future actions and policies are needed to tackle NCDs. © 2023},

	abstract = {Background: Experience-based knowledge and value considerations of health professionals, citizens, and patients are essential to formulate public health and clinical guidelines that are relevant and applicable to medical practice. Conventional methods for incorporating such knowledge into guideline development often involve a limited number of representatives and are considered to be time-consuming. Including experiential knowledge can be crucial during rapid guidance production in response to a pandemic but it is difficult to accomplish. Objective: This proof-of-concept study explored the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)–based methods to capture experiential knowledge and value considerations from existing data channels to make these insights available for public health guideline development. Methods: We developed and examined AI-based methods in relation to the COVID-19 vaccination guideline development in the Netherlands. We analyzed Dutch messages shared between December 2020 and June 2021 on social media and on 2 databases from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), where experiences and questions regarding COVID-19 vaccination are reported. First, natural language processing (NLP) filtering techniques and an initial supervised machine learning model were developed to identify this type of knowledge in a large data set. Subsequently, structural topic modeling was performed to discern thematic patterns related to experiences with COVID-19 vaccination. Results: NLP methods proved to be able to identify and analyze experience-based knowledge and value considerations in large data sets. They provide insights into a variety of experiential knowledge that is difficult to obtain otherwise for rapid guideline development. Some topics addressed by citizens, patients, and professionals can serve as direct feedback to recommendations in the guideline. For example, a topic pointed out that although travel was not considered as a reason warranting prioritization for vaccination in the national vaccination campaign, there was a considerable need for vaccines for indispensable travel, such as cross-border informal caregiving, work or study, or accessing specialized care abroad. Another example is the ambiguity regarding the definition of medical risk groups prioritized for vaccination, with many citizens not meeting the formal priority criteria while being equally at risk. Such experiential knowledge may help the early identification of problems with the guideline’s application and point to frequently occurring exceptions that might initiate a revision of the guideline text. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study presents NLP methods as viable tools to access and use experience-based knowledge and value considerations, possibly contributing to robust, equitable, and applicable guidelines. They offer a way for guideline developers to gain insights into health professionals, citizens, and patients’ experience-based knowledge, especially when conventional methods are difficult to implement. AI-based methods can thus broaden the evidence and knowledge base available for rapid guideline development and may therefore be considered as an important addition to the toolbox of pandemic preparedness. ©Lea Lösch, Teun Zuiderent-Jerak, Florian Kunneman, Elena Syurina, Marloes Bongers, Mart L Stein, Michelle Chan, Willemine Willems, Aura Timen.},

The healthcare industry will benefit immensely from this abundance of patient data from electronic health records (EHR), patient-reported outcomes (PROs), laboratory, demographic, social media, digital, and even climate data. Areas Covered: While conventional statistical methods still play a significant role in supporting the drug lifecycle, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are assuming a more prominent role in the analysis of this ‘big data.’ Moving forward, conventional statistics and AI/ML will work together to support descriptive, diagnostic, and even predictive analytics to further revolutionize drug discovery and development, regulatory approvals, and payer acceptance. In addition, counterfactual prescriptive analytics, such as causal inference analysis using real-world data (RWD) to generate insights that have cause-and-effect conclusions, will gain momentum as a methodology that can stand up against the rigor of regulatory review. Expert Opinion: Our real-world evidence/health economics and outcomes research (RWE/HEOR) field has evolved in ways that require us to integrate all the methods and data into a single framework that guides a holistic analytic approach and decision-making. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE via the US National Library of Medicine's PubMed portal; Web of Science (WoS); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Scopus; and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). Results: Twelve studies were eligible. Overall, the studies indicated that Latin American immigrant MSM have low HIV testing rates. This low testing rate can be influenced by various factors, including knowledge and awareness about HIV; stigma, discrimination, and confidence in health services; barriers to accessing healthcare; type of partnerships and relationships; lack of knowledge about their rights; migration and documentation status; and personal, cultural, and religious beliefs Conclusion: Public health interventions aimed at increasing HIV testing among Latin immigrants should directly address the fundamental reasons for not getting tested. This approach is likely to be more successful by taking into account the specific needs and circumstances of Latin immigrant men who have sex with men. © 2023 The Author(s).

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted progress on the strategy, but lessons learned during the pandemic – especially in vaccination, self administered testing, and coordinated mobilization on a global scale – may help with efforts to achieve its targets. However, we must also learn from the failure of the COVID-19 response to include adequate representation of global voices.

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health burden, necessitating a profound understanding of its multifaceted dimensions. This comprehensive review aims to unravel the etiology, decode pathophysiological mechanisms, navigate diagnostic modalities, explore pharmacological interventions, advocate lifestyle modifications, and chart the horizon of emerging therapies in the complex landscape of chronic cardiac dysfunction. The exploration of HF begins with an insightful journey into its diverse etiological factors, encompassing genetic predispositions, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Delving into pathophysiological mechanisms, this review elucidates the intricate processes of cardiac remodeling, neurohormonal activation, and cellular dysfunction that underlie the progression of HF. Diagnostic modalities play a pivotal role in unraveling the mysteries of HF by examining advanced imaging techniques, biomarkers, and comprehensive clinical assessments. The pharmacological interventions section provides an in-depth analysis of traditional medications, such as diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, while highlighting the emergence of novel drug classes transforming HF management. Advocating lifestyle modifications emphasizes the crucial role of diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation in enhancing patient outcomes. Lastly, the review delves into the promising horizon of emerging therapies, offering a glimpse into current research, innovative treatment approaches, and potential breakthroughs. As HF management faces challenges in patient compliance, healthcare access, and education, this comprehensive review aims to equip healthcare professionals and researchers with a holistic understanding of chronic cardiac dysfunction's intricacies. In conclusion, synthesizing key findings emphasizes the need for an integrated and multidimensional approach to effectively address the complex landscape of heart failure. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {The increasing access to health data worldwide is driving a resurgence in machine learning research, including data-hungry deep learning algorithms. More computationally efficient algorithms now offer unique opportunities to enhance diagnosis, risk stratification, and individualised approaches to patient management. Such opportunities are particularly relevant for the management of older patients, a group that is characterised by complex multimorbidity patterns and significant interindividual variability in homeostatic capacity, organ function, and response to treatment. Clinical tools that utilise machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal choice of treatment are slowly gaining the necessary approval from governing bodies and being implemented into healthcare, with significant implications for virtually all medical disciplines during the next phase of digital medicine. Beyond obtaining regulatory approval, a crucial element in implementing these tools is the trust and support of the people that use them. In this context, an increased understanding by clinicians of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms provides an appreciation of the possible benefits, risks, and uncertainties, and improves the chances for successful adoption. This review provides a broad taxonomy of machine learning algorithms, followed by a more detailed description of each algorithm class, their purpose and capabilities, and examples of their applications, particularly in geriatric medicine. Additional focus is given on the clinical implications and challenges involved in relying on devices with reduced interpretability and the progress made in counteracting the latter via the development of explainable machine learning. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {While chemicals are vital to modern society through materials, agriculture, textiles, new technology, medicines, and consumer goods, their use is not without risks. Unfortunately, our resources seem inadequate to address the breadth of chemical challenges to the environment and human health. Therefore, it is important we use our intelligence and knowledge wisely to prepare for what lies ahead. The present study used a Delphi-style approach to horizon-scan future chemical threats that need to be considered in the setting of chemicals and environmental policy, which involved a multidisciplinary, multisectoral, and multinational panel of 25 scientists and practitioners (mainly from the United Kingdom, Europe, and other industrialized nations) in a three-stage process. Fifteen issues were shortlisted (from a nominated list of 48), considered by the panel to hold global relevance. The issues span from the need for new chemical manufacturing (including transitioning to non-fossil-fuel feedstocks); challenges from novel materials, food imports, landfills, and tire wear; and opportunities from artificial intelligence, greater data transparency, and the weight-of-evidence approach. The 15 issues can be divided into three classes: new perspectives on historic but insufficiently appreciated chemicals/issues, new or relatively new products and their associated industries, and thinking through approaches we can use to meet these challenges. Chemicals are one threat among many that influence the environment and human health, and interlinkages with wider issues such as climate change and how we mitigate these were clear in this exercise. The horizon scan highlights the value of thinking broadly and consulting widely, considering systems approaches to ensure that interventions appreciate synergies and avoid harmful trade-offs in other areas. We recommend further collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators, and policymakers to perform horizon scanning to inform policymaking, to develop our ability to meet these challenges, and especially to extend the approach to consider also concerns from countries with developing economies.

	abstract = {The effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform diabetic retinal exams (‘screening’) on preventing vision loss is not known. We designed the Care Process for Preventing Vision Loss from Diabetes (CAREVL), as a Markov model to compare the effectiveness of point-of-care autonomous AI-based screening with in-office clinical exam by an eye care provider (ECP), on preventing vision loss among patients with diabetes. The estimated incidence of vision loss at 5 years was 1535 per 100,000 in the AI-screened group compared to 1625 per 100,000 in the ECP group, leading to a modelled risk difference of 90 per 100,000. The base-case CAREVL model estimated that an autonomous AI-based screening strategy would result in 27,000 fewer Americans with vision loss at 5 years compared with ECP. Vision loss at 5 years remained lower in the AI-screened group compared to the ECP group, in a wide range of parameters including optimistic estimates biased toward ECP. Real-world modifiable factors associated with processes of care could further increase its effectiveness. Of these factors, increased adherence with treatment was estimated to have the greatest impact. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoTs), it is crucial to acknowledge the potential security and privacy issues that arise from these advanced technologies in smart cities. This article provides overview of these concerns, highlighting the various ways in which smart city technologies can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other security threats. Additionally, the paper examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing smart cities to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public safety systems that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to hacking, leading to privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate power grids, are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or significant damage to vital infrastructure. The adoption of information and communication technology for smart city development has increased the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review cybersecurity governance model. In addition, smart city water systems that rely on AI-powered sensors to monitor water quality may also be at risk of hacking, which could result in the contamination of the water supply. Further research is required to better understand the potential risks associated with smart city technologies and develop new solutions to address them. This article shows as a valuable resource for city administrators, policymakers and researchers interested in the security and privacy concerns of smart cities. © 2023},

	abstract = {In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing and lockdown have been key options for controlling new or reemerging respiratory infectious disease outbreaks. The timely implementation of these interventions is vital for effectively controlling and safeguarding the economy.Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated whether, when, and to what level lockdowns are necessary to minimize epidemic and economic burdens of new disease outbreaks. We formulated the question as a sequential decision-making Markov Decision Process and solved it using deep Q-network algorithm. We evaluated the question under two objective functions: a 2-objective function to minimize economic burden and hospital capacity violations, suitable for diseases with severe health risks but with minimal death, and a 3-objective function that additionally minimizes the number of deaths, suitable for diseases that have high risk of mortality.A key feature of the model is that we evaluated the above questions in the context of two-geographical jurisdictions that interact through travel but make autonomous and independent decisions, evaluating under cross-jurisdictional cooperation and non-cooperation. In the 2-objective function under cross-jurisdictional cooperation, the optimal policy was to aim for shutdowns at 50 and 25% per day. Though this policy avoided hospital capacity violations, the shutdowns extended until a large proportion of the population reached herd immunity. Delays in initiating this optimal policy or non-cooperation from an outside jurisdiction required shutdowns at a higher level of 75% per day, thus adding to economic burdens. In the 3-objective function, the optimal policy under cross-jurisdictional cooperation was to aim for shutdowns of up to 75% per day to prevent deaths by reducing infected cases. This optimal policy continued for the entire duration of the simulation, suggesting that, until pharmaceutical interventions such as treatment or vaccines become available, contact reductions through physical distancing would be necessary to minimize deaths. Deviating from this policy increased the number of shutdowns and led to several deaths.In summary, we present a decision-analytic methodology for identifying optimal lockdown strategy under the context of interactions between jurisdictions that make autonomous and independent decisions. The numerical analysis outcomes are intuitive and, as expected, serve as proof of the feasibility of such a model. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the optimal policy exhibits robustness to minor alterations in the transmission rate, yet shows sensitivity to more substantial deviations. This finding underscores the dynamic nature of epidemic parameters, thereby emphasizing the necessity for models trained across a diverse range of values to ensure effective policy-making. ©2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess Australian and New Zealand emergency clinicians' attitudes towards the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in emergency medicine. Methods: We undertook a qualitative interview-based study based on grounded theory. Participants were recruited through ED internal mailing lists, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Bulletin, and the research teams' personal networks. Interviews were transcribed, coded and themes presented. Results: Twenty-five interviews were conducted between July 2021 and May 2022. Thematic saturation was achieved after 22 interviews. Most participants were from either Western Australia (52%) or Victoria (16%) and were consultants (96%). More participants reported feeling optimistic (10/25) than neutral (6/25), pessimistic (2/25) or mixed (7/25) towards the use of AI in the ED. A minority expressed scepticism regarding the feasibility or value of implementing AI into the ED. Multiple potential risks and ethical issues were discussed by participants including skill loss from overreliance on AI, algorithmic bias, patient privacy and concerns over liability. Participants also discussed perceived inadequacies in existing information technology systems. Participants felt that AI technologies would be used as decision support tools and not replace the roles of emergency clinicians. Participants were not concerned about the impact of AI on their job security. Most (17/25) participants thought that AI would impact emergency medicine within the next 10 years. Conclusions: Emergency clinicians interviewed were generally optimistic about the use of AI in emergency medicine, so long as it is used as a decision support tool and they maintain the ability to override its recommendations. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing amount of discussion on the use of big data to prevent and treat pandemics. The current research aimed to use CiteSpace (CS) visual analysis to uncover research and development trends, to help academics decide on future research and to create a framework for enterprises and organizations in order to plan for the growth of big data-based epidemic control. First, a total of 202 original papers were retrieved from Web of Science (WOS) using a complete list and analyzed using CS scientometric software. The CS parameters included the date range (from 2011 to 2022, a 1-year slice for co-authorship as well as for the co-accordance assessment), visualization (to show the fully integrated networks), specific selection criteria (the top 20 percent), node form (author, institution, region, reference cited, referred author, journal, and keywords), and pruning (pathfinder, slicing network). Lastly, the correlation of data was explored and the findings of the visualization analysis of big data pandemic control research were presented. According to the findings, “COVID-19 infection” was the hottest cluster with 31 references in 2020, while “Internet of things (IoT) platform and unified health algorithm” was the emerging research topic with 15 citations. “Influenza, internet, China, human mobility, and province” were the emerging keywords in the year 2021–2022 with strength of 1.61 to 1.2. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the top institution, which collaborated with 15 other organizations. Qadri and Wilson were the top authors in this field. The Lancet journal accepted the most papers in this field, while the United States, China, and Europe accounted for the bulk of articles in this research. The research showed how big data may help us to better understand and control pandemics. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The launch of OpenAI’s GPT-3 model in June 2020 began a new era for conversational chatbots. While there are chatbots that do not use artificial intelligence (AI), conversational chatbots integrate AI language models that allow for back-and-forth conversation between an AI system and a human user. GPT-3, since upgraded to GPT-4, harnesses a natural language processing technique called sentence embedding and allows for conversations with users that are more nuanced and realistic than before. The launch of this model came in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, where increases in health care needs globally combined with social distancing measures made virtual medicine more relevant than ever. GPT-3 and other conversational models have been used for a wide variety of medical purposes, from providing basic COVID-19–related guidelines to personalized medical advice and even prescriptions. The line between medical professionals and conversational chatbots is somewhat blurred, notably in hard-to-reach communities where the chatbot replaced face-to-face health care. Considering these blurred lines and the circumstances accelerating the adoption of conversational chatbots globally, we analyze the use of these tools from an ethical perspective. Notably, we map out the many types of risks in the use of conversational chatbots in medicine to the principles of medical ethics. In doing so, we propose a framework for better understanding the effects of these chatbots on both patients and the medical field more broadly, with the hope of informing safe and appropriate future developments. © Eleonore Fournier-Tombs, Juliette McHardy.},

	abstract = {Despite recent efforts by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community to move towards standardised procedures for documenting models, methods, systems or datasets, there is currently no methodology focused on use cases aligned with the risk-based approach of the European AI Act (AI Act). In this paper, we propose a new framework for the documentation of use cases that we call use case cards, based on the use case modelling included in the Unified Markup Language (UML) standard. Unlike other documentation methodologies, we focus on the intended purpose and operational use of an AI system. It consists of two main parts: firstly, a UML-based template, tailored to allow implicitly assessing the risk level of the AI system and defining relevant requirements, and secondly, a supporting UML diagram designed to provide information about the system-user interactions and relationships. The proposed framework is the result of a co-design process involving a relevant team of EU policy experts and scientists. We have validated our proposal with 11 experts with different backgrounds and a reasonable knowledge of the AI Act as a prerequisite. We provide the 5 use case cards used in the co-design and validation process. Use case cards allows framing and contextualising use cases in an effective way, and we hope this methodology can be a useful tool for policy makers and providers for documenting use cases, assessing the risk level, adapting the different requirements and building a catalogue of existing usages of AI. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges to clinical research, necessitating the adoption of innovative and remote methods to conduct studies. This study aimed to investigate these challenges and propose solutions for conducting clinical research during the pandemic. Methods: A narrative review was conducted (approval ID: IR.AMS.REC.1401.029), utilizing keyword searches in PubMed and Web of Science (WOS) citation index expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) from January 2020 to January 2023. Keywords included COVID-19, clinical research, barriers, obstacles, facilitators and enablers. Results: Out of 2508 records retrieved, 43 studies were reviewed, providing valuable insights into the challenges and corresponding solutions for conducting clinical research during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identified challenges were categorized into four main groups: issues related to researchers or investigators, issues related to participants and ethical concerns, administrative issues, and issues related to research implementation. To address these challenges, multiple strategies were proposed, including remote monitoring through phone or video visits, online data collection and interviews to minimize in-person contact, development of virtual platforms for participant interaction and questionnaire completion, consideration of financial incentives, adherence to essential criteria such as inclusion and exclusion parameters, participant compensation, and risk assessment for vulnerable patients. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted clinical research, requiring the adaptation and enhancement of existing research structures. Although remote methods and electronic equipment have limitations, they hold promise as effective solutions during this challenging period. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Although great progress has been made in the diagnostic and treatment options for dyslipidemias, unawareness, underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these disorders remain a significant global health concern. Growth in digital applications and newer models of care provide novel tools to improve the management of chronic conditions such as dyslipidemia. In this review, we discuss the evolving landscape of lipid management in the 21st century, current treatment gaps and possible solutions through digital health and new models of care. Our discussion begins with the history and development of value-based care and the national establishment of quality metrics for various chronic conditions. These concepts on the level of healthcare policy not only inform reimbursements but also define the standard of care. Next, we consider the advances in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score calculators as well as evolving imaging modalities. The impact and growth of digital health, ranging from telehealth visits to online platforms and mobile applications, will also be explored. We then evaluate the ways in which machine learning and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms are being utilized to address gaps in lipid management. From an organizational perspective, we trace the redesign of medical practices to incorporate a multidisciplinary team model of care, recognizing that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk is multifaceted and requires a comprehensive approach. Finally, we anticipate the future of dyslipidemia management, assessing the many ways in which atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden can be reduced on a population-wide scale.

	abstract = {In patients presenting with low back pain (LBP), once specific causes are excluded (fracture, infection, inflammatory arthritis, cancer, cauda equina and radiculopathy) many clinicians pose a diagnosis of non-specific LBP. Accordingly, current management of non-specific LBP is generic. There is a need for a classification of non-specific LBP that is both data- and evidence-based assessing multi-dimensional pain-related factors in a large sample size. The "PRedictive Evidence Driven Intelligent Classification Tool for Low Back Pain"(PREDICT- LBP) project is a prospective cross-sectional study which will compare 300 women and men with non-specific LBP (aged 18-55 years) with 100 matched referents without a history of LBP. Participants will be recruited from the general public and local medical facilities. Data will be collected on spinal tissue (intervertebral disc composition and morphology, vertebral fat fraction and paraspinal muscle size and composition via magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), central nervous system adaptation (pain thresholds, temporal summation of pain, brain resting state functional connectivity, structural connectivity and regional volumes via MRI), psychosocial factors (e.g. depression, anxiety) and other musculoskeletal pain symptoms. Dimensionality reduction, cluster validation and fuzzy c-means clustering methods, classification models, and relevant sensitivity analyses, will classify non-specific LBP patients into sub-groups. This project represents a first personalised diagnostic approach to non-specific LBP, with potential for widespread uptake in clinical practice. This project will provide evidence to support clinical trials assessing specific treatments approaches for potential subgroups of patients with non-specific LBP. The classification tool may lead to better patient outcomes and reduction in economic costs.  © 2023 Belavy et al.

It will investigate the interconnections between AI, accountable decisions made by boards of directors in companies, the associated legal risks, and how to regulate AI to mitigate risks while promoting accountability. In the boardroom, AI is defined as the use of computers to assist, support, collaborate or even duplicate directors’ behaviours. The last few years have seen increased calls for boards to have oversight responsibility at the intersection between AI and the regulatory and policy implications in a corporate setting. AI can be applied to advance the effectiveness and efficiency of corporate governance and to raise awareness of accountable practice in its standardisation and implementation. However, AI can also be a disruptive technology, and the accountable practice of AI needs to be reinforced by regulatory insight to enable its sustainable development. No consensus has yet been reached on the most appropriate regulatory framework to achieve these goals; this article therefore aims to identify the most appropriate regulatory framework to promote sustainable AI by monitoring and mitigating the associated risks in a corporate setting. We investigate the rationale for and advantages of a smart regulatory approach for regulating AI, aiming to achieve the participation of multi-disciplinary teams with members playing particular roles associated with the safe and effective deployment of AI. © 2024},

	abstract = {Crowds can be subject to intrinsic and extrinsic sources of risk, and previous records have shown that, in the absence of adequate safety measures, these sources of risk can jeopardise human lives. To mitigate these risks, we propose that implementation of multiple layers of safety measures for crowds—what we label The Swiss Cheese Model of Crowd Safety—should become the norm for crowd safety practice. Such system incorporates a multitude of safety protection layers including regulations and policymaking, planning and risk assessment, operational control, community preparedness, and incident response. The underlying premise of such model is that when one (or multiple) layer(s) of safety protection fail(s), the other layer(s) can still prevent an accident. In practice, such model requires a more effective implementation of technology, which can enable provision of real-time data, improved communication and coordination, and efficient incident response. Moreover, implementation of this model necessitates more attention to the overlooked role of public education, awareness raising, and promoting crowd safety culture at broad community levels, as one of last lines of defence against catastrophic outcomes for crowds. Widespread safety culture and awareness has the potential to empower individuals with the knowledge and skills that can prevent such outcomes or mitigate their impacts, when all other (exogenous) layers of protection (such as planning and operational control) fail. This requires safety campaigns and development of widespread educational programs. We conclude that, there is no panacea solution to the crowd safety problem, but a holistic multi-layered safety system that utilises active participation of all potential stakeholders can significantly reduce the likelihood of disastrous accidents. At a global level, we need to target a Vision Zero of Crowd Safety, i.e., set a global initiative of bringing deaths and severe injuries in crowded spaces to zero by a set year. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Introduction: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronically progressive mental condition, associated with a reduced quality of life and greater disability. Patient admissions are preventable events with a considerable impact on global functioning and social adjustment. While machine learning (ML) approaches have proven prediction ability in other diseases, little is known about their utility to predict patient admissions in this pathology. Aim: To develop prediction models for hospital admission/readmission within 5 years of diagnosis in patients with BD using ML techniques. Methods: The study utilized data from patients diagnosed with BD in a major healthcare organization in Colombia. Candidate predictors were selected from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and included sociodemographic and clinical variables. ML algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regressions, and Support Vector Machines, were used to predict patient admission or readmission. Survival models, including a penalized Cox Model and Random Survival Forest, were used to predict time to admission and first readmission. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and concordance index. Results: The admission dataset included 2,726 BD patients, with 354 admissions, while the readmission dataset included 352 patients, with almost half being readmitted. The best-performing model for predicting admission was the Random Forest, with an accuracy score of 0.951 and an AUC of 0.98. The variables with the greatest predictive power in the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) importance analysis were the number of psychiatric emergency visits, the number of outpatient follow-up appointments and age. Survival models showed similar results, with the Random Survival Forest performing best, achieving an AUC of 0.95. However, the prediction models for patient readmission had poorer performance, with the Random Forest model being again the best performer but with an AUC below 0.70. Conclusion: ML models, particularly the Random Forest model, outperformed traditional statistical techniques for admission prediction. However, readmission prediction models had poorer performance.

	abstract = {The Semmelweis Study is a prospective occupational cohort study that seeks to enroll all employees of Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary) aged 25 years and older, with a population of 8866 people, 70.5% of whom are women. The study builds on the successful experiences of the Whitehall II study and aims to investigate the complex relationships between lifestyle, environmental, and occupational risk factors, and the development and progression of chronic age-associated diseases. An important goal of the Semmelweis Study is to identify groups of people who are aging unsuccessfully and therefore have an increased risk of developing age-associated diseases. To achieve this, the study takes a multidisciplinary approach, collecting economic, social, psychological, cognitive, health, and biological data. The Semmelweis Study comprises a baseline data collection with open healthcare data linkage, followed by repeated data collection waves every 5 years. Data are collected through computer-assisted self-completed questionnaires, followed by a physical health examination, physiological measurements, and the assessment of biomarkers. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the Semmelweis Study, including its origin, context, objectives, design, relevance, and expected contributions. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction A rise in premature mortality - defined here as death during the most productive years of life, between adolescence and middle adulthood (15-60 years) - is contributing to stalling life expectancy in high-income countries. Causes of mortality vary, but often include substance misuse, suicide, unintentional injury and non-communicable disease. The development of evidence-informed policy frameworks to guide new approaches to prevention require knowledge of early targets for intervention, and interactions between higher level drivers. Here, we aim to: (1) identify systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses focused on intervention targets for premature mortality (in which intervention targets are causes of mortality that can, at least hypothetically, be modified to reduce risk); (2) evaluate the review quality and risk of bias; (3) compare and evaluate each review's, and their relevant primary studies, findings to identify existing evidence gaps. Methods and analysis In May 2023, we searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for peer-reviewed papers published in the English language in the 12 years from 2012 to 2023 that examined intervention targets for mortality. Screening will narrow these papers to focus on systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses, and their primary papers. Our outcome is death between ages 15 and 60 years; with potential intervention targets measured prior to death. A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) will be used to assess quality and risk of bias within included systematic reviews. Results will be synthesised narratively due to anticipated heterogeneity between reviews and between primary studies contained within included reviews. Ethics and dissemination This review will synthesise findings from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and their primary reviewed studies, meaning ethics committee approval is not required. Our findings will inform cross-cohort consortium development, be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and be presented at national and international conferences.

	abstract = {Anti-Black discrimination has existed within the field of radiology and professional organizations since their inception, and it is critical to understand this history and resultant structural racism to address current race-based disparities within the practice of radiology for patients and radiologists alike. Current disparities in the access to diagnostic imaging for Black patients and the underrepresentation of Black physicians in radiology, relative to their representation in the general U.S. population, reflect contemporary consequences of historical anti-Black discrimination. These disparities have existed within the field of radiology and professional medical organizations since their inception. Explicit and implicit racism against Black patients and physicians was institutional policy in the early 20th century when radiology was being developed as a clinical medical field. Early radiology organizations also embraced this structural discrimination, creating strong barriers to professional Black radiologist involvement. Nevertheless, there were numerous pioneering Black radiologists who advanced scholarship, patient care, and diversity within medicine and radiology during the early 20th century. This work remains important in the present day, as race-based health care disparities persist and continue to decrease the quality of radiology-delivered patient care. There are also structural barriers within radiology affecting workforce diversity that negatively impact marginalized groups. Multiple opportunities exist today for antiracism work to improve quality of care and to apply standards of social justice and health equity to the field of radiology. An initial step is to expand education on the disparities in access to imaging and health care among Black patients. Institutional interventions include implementing community-based outreach and applying antibias methodology in artificial intelligence algorithms, while systemic interventions include identifying national race-based quality measures and ensuring imaging guidelines properly address the unique cancer risks in the Black patient population. These approaches reflect some of the strategies that may mutually serve to address health care disparities in radiology. © 2023, Radiological Society of North America Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is an idiopathic disease that occurs during mid-to-late pregnancy and is associated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes, including intrauterine fetal demise. However, since the underlying cause of ICP remains unclear, there is an ongoing debate on the phenotyping criteria used in the diagnostic process. Here, we identified single- and multi-symptomatic ICP (ICP-S and ICP-M) in 104,221 Chinese females from the ZEBRA maternity cohort, with the objective of exploring the risk implications of the two phenotypes on pregnancy outcomes and from environmental exposures. We employed multivariate binary logistic regression to estimate confounder-adjusted odds ratios and found that ICP-M was more strongly associated with preterm birth and low birth weight compared to ICP-S. Throughout pregnancy, incremental exposure to PM2.5, O3, and greenness could alter ICP risks by 17.3%, 12.5%, and –2.3%, respectively, with more substantial associations observed with ICP-M than with ICP-S. The major scientific advancements lie in the elucidation of synergistic risk interactions between pollutants and the protective antagonistic effects of greenness, as well as highlighting the risk impact of preconceptional environmental exposures. Our study, conducted in the context of the “three-child policy” in China, provides epidemiological evidence for policy-making to safeguard maternal and neonatal health. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Infection science is a discipline of healthcare which includes clinical microbiology, public health microbiology, mechanisms of microbial disease, and antimicrobial countermeasures. The importance of infection science has become more apparent in recent years during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent highlighting of critical operational domains within infection science including the hospital, clinical laboratory, and public health environments to prevent, manage, and treat infectious diseases. However, as the global community transitions beyond the pandemic, the importance of infection science remains, with emerging infectious diseases, bloodstream infections, sepsis, and antimicrobial resistance becoming increasingly significant contributions to the burden of global disease. Machine learning (ML) is frequently applied in healthcare and medical domains, with growing interest in the application of ML techniques to problems in infection science. This has the potential to address several key aspects including improving patient outcomes, optimising workflows in the clinical laboratory, and supporting the management of public health. However, despite promising results, the implementation of ML into clinical practice and workflows is limited. Enabling the migration of ML models from the research to real world environment requires the development of trustworthy ML systems that support the requirements of users, stakeholders, and regulatory agencies. This paper will provide readers with a brief introduction to infection science, outline the principles of trustworthy ML systems, provide examples of the application of these principles in infection science, and propose future directions for moving towards the development of trustworthy ML systems in infection science. 2023 McFadden, Reynolds and Inglis.},

	abstract = {Visceral adipose tissue plays a central role in obesity and metabolic syndrome and is an independent risk factor for both cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Increased visceral adipose tissue promotes adipokine dysregulation and insulin resistance, leading to several health issues, including systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Moreover, an increase in adipose tissue directly and indirectly affects the kidneys by increasing renal sodium reabsorption, causing glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertrophy, which leads to increased proteinuria and kidney fibrosis/dysfunction. Although the interest in the adverse effects of obesity on renal diseases has grown exponentially in recent years, the relationship between obesity and renal prognosis remains controversial. This may be attributed to the long clinical course of obesity, numerous obesity-related metabolic complications, and patients’ attributes. Multiple individual attributes influencing the pathophysiology of fat accumulation make it difficult to understand obesity. In such cases, it may be effective to elucidate the pathophysiology by conducting research tailored to individual attributes from the perspective of attribute-based medicine/personalized medicine. We consider the appropriate use of clinical indicators necessary, according to attributes such as chronic kidney disease stage, level of visceral adipose tissue accumulation, age, and sex. Selecting treatments and clinical indicators based on individual attributes will allow for advancements in the clinical management of patients with obesity and chronic kidney disease. In the clinical setting of obesity-related nephropathy, it is first necessary to accumulate attribute-based studies resulting from the accurate evaluation of visceral fat accumulation to establish evidence for promoting personalized medicine.

Secondary data are information being used for purposes other than those intended when they were collected. These data can be gathered from sources on the verge of widespread use such as the internet, wearables, mobile phone apps, electronic health records, or genome sequencing. To utilise their full potential, we offer guidance by outlining available sources and approaches for the processing of secondary data. Furthermore, in addition to indicators for the regulatory and ethical evaluation of strategies for the best use of secondary data, we also propose criteria for assessing reusability.

	abstract = {Access to medical imaging is pivotal in healthcare, playing a crucial role in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of diseases. However, disparities persist in this scenario, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, racial and ethnic minorities, and individuals facing linguistic or cultural barriers. This paper critically assesses methods to mitigate these disparities, with a focus on breast cancer screening. We underscore scientific mobility as a vital tool for radiologists to advocate for healthcare policy changes: it not only enhances diversity and cultural competence within the radiology community but also fosters international cooperation and knowledge exchange among healthcare institutions. Efforts to ensure cultural competency among radiologists are discussed, including ongoing cultural education, sensitivity training, and workforce diversification. These initiatives are key to improving patient communication and reducing healthcare disparities. This paper also highlights the crucial role of policy changes and legislation in promoting equal access to essential screening services like mammography. We explore the challenges and potential of teleradiology in improving access to medical imaging in remote and underserved areas. In the era of artificial intelligence, this paper emphasizes the necessity of validating its models across a spectrum of populations to prevent bias and achieve equitable healthcare outcomes. Finally, the importance of international collaboration is illustrated, showcasing its role in sharing insights and strategies to overcome global access barriers in medical imaging. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the challenges related to disparities in medical imaging access and proposes actionable strategies to address these challenges, aiming for equitable healthcare delivery. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, gene editing, nanotechnology, neurotechnology and robotics, which were originally unrelated or separated, are becoming more closely integrated. Consequently, the boundaries between the physical-biological and the cyber-digital worlds are no longer well defined. We argue that this technological convergence has fundamental implications for individuals and societies. Conventional domain-specific governance mechanisms have become ineffective. In this paper we provide an overview of the ethical, societal and policy challenges of technological convergence. Particularly, we scrutinize the adequacy of domain-specific governance mechanisms in the face of such integrated technologies and highlight their growing ineffectiveness. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive governance framework that is anticipatory, inclusive, and resilient. Central to this framework is the principle of participatory governance, which calls for a proactive engagement of all stakeholders, including those from marginalized and vulnerable populations, ensuring that their voices and concerns shape the trajectory of technological development. The framework emphasizes the need for protective measures that preemptively address potential risks and inequities that may arise from the adoption and integration of emerging technologies. Based on a detailed analysis of case studies and current governance models, we present and discuss a set of ten actionable recommendations. These are designed to facilitate the transition towards a governance approach that not only respects individual autonomy and privacy, but also fosters a collective responsibility towards sustainable and fair technological progress. By placing human dignity, societal welfare and the protection of the most vulnerable at the center of technological innovation, we advocate for a future where convergence is synonymous with progress that is both ethically grounded and universally beneficial. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background Oesophageal cancer has significant morbidity and mortality but late diagnosis is common since early signs of disease are frequently misinterpreted. Project DELTA aims to enable earlier detection and treatment through targeted screening using a novel risk prediction algorithm for oesophageal cancer (incorporating risk factors of Barrett’s oesophagus including prescriptions for acid-reducing medications (CanPredict)), together with a non-invasive, low-cost sampling device (CytospongeTM). However, there are many barriers to implementation, and this paper identifies key ethical and legal challenges to implementing these personalised prevention strategies for Barrett’s oesophagus/oesophageal cancer. Methods To identify ethical and legal issues relevant to the deployment of a risk prediction tool for oesophageal cancer into primary care, we adopted an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating targeted informal literature reviews, interviews with expert collaborators, a multidisciplinary workshop and ethical and legal analysis. Results Successful implementation raises many issues including ensuring transparency and effective risk communication; addressing bias and inequity; managing resources appropriately and avoiding exceptionalism. Clinicians will need support and training to use cancer risk prediction algorithms, ensuring that they understand how risk algorithms supplement rather than replace medical decision-making. Workshop participants had concerns about liability for harms arising from risk algorithms, including from potential bias and inequitable implementation. Determining strategies for risk communication enabling transparency but avoiding exceptionalist approaches are a significant challenge. Future challenges include using artificial intelligence to bolster risk assessment, incorporating genomics into risk tools, and deployment by non-health professional users. However, these strategies could improve detection and outcomes. Conclusions Novel pathways incorporating risk prediction algorithms hold considerable promise, especially when combined with low-cost sampling. However immediate priorities should be to develop risk communication strategies that take account of using validated risk algorithms, and to ensure equitable implementation. Resolving questions about liability for harms arising should be a longer-term objective. © 2023 Brigden et al.

	abstract = {Ensuring access to affordable energy for all is laid out among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and it remains an important open question as to how the popularity and widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workforce impact household energy resources consumption. To systematically investigate the impacts of the application of artificial intelligence in the workforce on household energy consumption in China, empirical analysis is conducted using data from the China General Social Survey (CGSS) from May to September 2022. The findings are as follows: (1) AI significantly reduces household energy consumption. Controlling other factors constant, for a one-standard-deviation increase in the impact of AI, household energy consumption drops by an average of 10.751%. Robustness and endogeneity tests, including dealing with missing values, using different energy consumption and AI indicators, as well as applying instrumental variable method, placebo test and penalized regressions, confirm this conclusion. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that AI reduces energy consumption by lowering household income and increasing their financial fragility. (3) AI's impacts on different types of energy consumption are heterogeneous. Its negative effects are mainly observed in the significant reduction of electricity and gas consumption. Furthermore, it increases the probability of using solid fuels such as honeycomb coal, coal lumps, traditional biomass, etc., thereby increasing the reliance on low-grade energy resources and raising the risk of energy poverty. (4) AI has greater negative effects on those who do not have access to energy subsidies and households with poor energy security and stability, lower income and inadequate social security. Besides, its impacts on regions with higher levels of technological development are more prominent. (5) Feasible pathways to mitigate the adverse effects of AI are explored. It is found that improving labor protection can help alleviate its adverse consequences on energy consumption. This paper provides evidence on the impacts of technological disruption from a demand-based perspective. It highlights the need for better policies on energy, social security, income distribution and labor protection to weaken AI's effects on household energy consumption and prevent them from falling into energy poverty. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As society and the economy gravitates toward cleaner and renewable energy, the energy sector continues to diversify and increase in complexity, leading to a 'never normal' business portfolio and project delivery. On top of safeguarding On Time, On Budget, and On Scope delivery, this constant state of change also warrants new ways of managing Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). At PETRONAS, new ways of working is synonymous with digital transformation. Hence, this paper will outline how PETRONAS leverages digital technologies in managing HSE risks in project delivery. Since 2019, the project delivery arm of PETRONAS has invested in developing an artificial intelligence (AI) predictive model to predict future HSE risks and incidents based on historical HSE incident big data. Coupled with real-time data visualization and prescription of control measures, this digital solution has greatly enabled the organization to rationalize resources and implement informed, risk-based interventions. Considerable efforts have been made to operationalize the predictive tool, which includes stakeholder management, change management, as well as work process enhancement to incorporate automation and have end-to-end oversight on risk mitigation and intervention. This provides a HSE management framework that focuses on data-driven decision-making, which translates to targeted intervention with pace. As a result, PETRONAS project delivery arm has seen incident reduction of more than 55% for both injurious and non-injurious incidents in 2022 in comparison to the preceding three-year average. In addition, the implementation of the digital solution has enabled an improved process cycle efficiency of HSE risk management from 32% to 97%, with a reduction of total mantime of 143 hours. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {The European Commission has pioneered the coercive regulation of artificial intelligence (AI), including a proposal of banning some applications altogether on moral grounds. Core to its regulatory strategy is a nominally “risk-based” approach with interventions that are proportionate to risk levels. Yet, neither standard accounts of risk-based regulation as rational problem-solving endeavor nor theories of organizational legitimacy-seeking, both prominently discussed in Regulation & Governance, fully explain the Commission's attraction to the risk heuristic. This article responds to this impasse with three contributions. First, it enrichens risk-based regulation scholarship—beyond AI—with a firm foundation in constructivist and critical political economy accounts of emerging tech regulation to capture the performative politics of defining and enacting risk vis-à-vis global economic competitiveness. Second, it conceptualizes the role of risk analysis within a Cultural Political Economy framework: as a powerful epistemic tool for the discursive and regulatory differentiation of an uncertain regulatory terrain (semiosis and structuration) which the Commission wields in its pursuit of a future common European AI market. Thirdly, the paper offers an in-depth empirical reconstruction of the Commission's risk-based semiosis and structuration in AI regulation through qualitative analysis of a substantive sample of documents and expert interviews. This finds that the Commission's use of risk analysis, outlawing some AI uses as matters of deep value conflicts and tightly controlling (at least discursively) so-called high-risk AI systems, enables Brussels to fashion its desired trademark of European “cutting-edge AI … trusted throughout the world” in the first place. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Harnessing AI for evidence-based policymaking in e-governance has the potential to revolutionize the way governments formulate and implement policies. By leveraging AI technologies, governments can analyze vast amounts of data, extract valuable insights, and make informed decisions based on evidence. This chapter explores the various ways in which AI can be employed in e-governance to facilitate evidence-based policymaking. It discusses the use of AI algorithms for data analysis and prediction, enabling governments to identify patterns, trends, and emerging issues from diverse data sources. Moreover, AI-powered tools can enhance citizen engagement and participation, by facilitating data-driven decision-making processes and providing personalized services. Additionally, AI can assist in policy evaluation and impact assessment, by automating the collection and analysis of data, thus enabling governments to measure the effectiveness of their policies in real-time. Furthermore, AI can contribute to enhancing transparency and accountability in e-governance, by automating processes such as fraud detection and risk assessment. Despite the immense potential, the adoption of AI in e-governance must address challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and ethical considerations. This chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of building trust, ensuring fairness, and promoting responsible AI practices to maximize the benefits of AI in evidence-based policymaking for e-governance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

We introduce a theoretical framework, Extended Markov Ratio Decision Processes (EMRDP), that incorporates risk into MDPs and embeds environment learning into this framework. We propose an algorithm to find the optimal policy for EMRDP with theoretical guarantees. Under a certain monotonicity assumption, this algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time both in the discounted and expected average reward models. We validate our algorithm empirically on a Grid World benchmark, evaluating its solution quality, required number of steps, and numerical stability. We find its solution quality to be stable under data noising, while its required number of steps grows with added noise. We observe its numerical stability compared to global methods. © 2023 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to identify contributing risk factors for pedestrian injury by integrating socio-spatial and street-level contexts through multimodal deep learning to overcome the limitations of existing studies that only consider one type of data. To investigate how the two contexts assist in describing pedestrian injury risk, six multimodal deep learning models were established by varying the ratio integrating the two contexts. The developed model with the highest performance was interpreted by using two XAI methods: SHAP for socio-spatial context and Grad-CAM for street-level context. The results indicated that the street-level context mainly contributes to the pedestrian injury risk level, assisted by the socio-spatial context, which cannot be captured at the street-level. The three main contributing risk factors were identified through model interpretation: the fragmented sky view due to the locations of high-rise buildings, the placement of crosswalks in areas adjacent to public transits, and interregional sociodemographic disparities. This study provides insight into the use of integrating two different urban contexts to identify pedestrian injury risk factors, which are expected to support improvement strategies that enhance public health. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Risk-averse Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have optimal policies that achieve high returns with low variability, but these MDPs are often difficult to solve. Only a few risk-averse objectives admit a dynamic programming (DP) formulation, which is the mainstay of most MDP and RL algorithms. We derive a new DP formulation for discounted risk-averse MDPs with Entropic Risk Measure (ERM) and Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) objectives. Our DP formulation for ERM, which is possible because of our novel definition of value function with time-dependent risk levels, can approximate optimal policies in a time that is polynomial in the approximation error. We then use the ERM algorithm to optimize the EVaR objective in polynomial time using an optimized discretization scheme. Our numerical results show the viability of our formulations and algorithms in discounted MDPs. Copyright © 2023 by the author(s)},

Analyzing the security risks of artificial intelligence, improved legal policies are proposed from the perspective of technology and privacy. The results show that the effect of improving privacy protection policy on privacy protection is 0.85, and the effect of clarifying subject rights is 0.9. The introduction of laws should consider social ethics, and the effect degree of ethical principles is 0.75.

Risk management and Network Security Governance (NSG) are complex, and this paper discusses the challenges and strategies needed to protect digital assets in a more vulnerable cyber environment. Cyber threats are constantly changing, technological integration is complex, and regulatory compliance is severe, all of which make it more challenging to maintain robust network security. NSG requires strong security rules and standards, which this conversation must address. The ever-changing threat environment demands that these regulations be open, accurate, and flexible. Risk management identifying, assessing, and mitigating threats—is essential to regulatory compliance and organizational reputation, according to the article. Risk mitigation methods like proactive, investigative, and remedial approaches are examined, along with cybersecurity advancements like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

	abstract = {One of the most troubling trends in criminal investigations is the growing use of “black box” technology, in which law enforcement rely on artificial intelligence (AI) models or algorithms that are either too complex for people to understand or they simply conceal how it functions. In criminal cases, black box systems have proliferated in forensic areas such as DNA mixture interpretation, facial recognition, and recidivism risk assessments. The champions and critics of AI argue, mistakenly, that we face a catch 22: While black box AI is not understandable by people, they assume that it produces more accurate forensic evidence. In this Article, we question this assertion, which has so powerfully affected judges, policymakers, and academics. We describe a mature body of computer science research showing how “glass box” AI—designed to be interpretable—can be more accurate than black box alternatives. Indeed, black box AI performs predictably worse in settings like the criminal system. Debunking the black box performance myth has implications for forensic evidence, constitutional criminal procedure rights, and legislative policy. Absent some compelling—or even credible—government interest in keeping AI as a black box, and given the constitutional rights and public safety interests at stake, we argue that a substantial burden rests on the government to justify black box AI in criminal cases. We conclude by calling for judicial rulings and legislation to safeguard a right to interpretable forensic AI. Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.

Concerns about AI's vulnerabilities and future threats have, however, long been debated among scientists and the tech community. By integrating Beck's theory of risk society with an audience-centered sense-making approach, we seek to understand the effects of AI on the general public's daily lives and their concerns when they adopt AI technology. Five focus groups with 36 participants from Singapore, a technologically advanced country, were conducted to investigate their risk perceptions of AI and AI-powered technology. We found that participants were not passive consumers of content showing up on their news feeds; indeed, some participants attempted to outsmart the algorithms. They were aware that tech companies often tweak algorithms to personalize content and drive consumers into rabbit holes. Nevertheless, despite a certain level of awareness and sporadic attempts to “outsmart” the system, many users might still be influenced by these algorithms, underscoring the extent to which consumers are often manipulated by smart tech powered by AI. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications of our findings by looking at the contextual factors. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite technological advancements to enhance patient health, the risks of not discovering the correct interactions and trends in digital health are high. Hence, a careful policy is required for health coverage tailored to needs and capacity. Therefore, this study aims to explore the adoption of a cognitive computing decision support system (CCDSS) in the assessment of health-care policymaking and validates it by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted to collect data from different stakeholders, referred to as the 4Ps, namely, patients, providers, payors and policymakers. Structural equation modelling and one-way ANOVA were used to analyse the data. Findings: The result reveals that the behavioural insight of policymakers towards the assessment of health-care policymaking is based on automatic and reflective systems. Investments in CCDSS for policymaking assessment have the potential to produce rational outcomes. CCDSS, built with quality procedures, can validate whether breastfeeding-supporting policies are mother-friendly. Research limitations/implications: Health-care policies are used by lawmakers to safeguard and improve public health, but it has always been a challenge. With the adoption of CCDSS, the overall goal of health-care policymaking can achieve better quality standards and improve the design of policymaking. Originality/value: This study drew attention to how CCDSS as a technology enabler can drive health-care policymaking assessment for each stage and how the technology enabler can help the 4Ps of health-care gain insight into the benefits and potential value of CCDSS by demonstrating the breastfeeding supporting policy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 have shot to prominence recently (Lin 2023), as dramatic advances have shown them to be capable of writing plausible output that is difficult to distinguish from human-authored content. Unsurprisingly, this has led to concerns about their use by students in tertiary education contexts (Swiecki et al. 2022) and it has led to them being banned in some school districts in the United States (e.g. Rosenblatt 2023; Clarridge 2023) and from at least one top-ranking international university (e.g. Reuters 2023). There are legitimate reasons for such fears to be held, as it is difficult to differentiate students’ own written work presented for assessment from that produced by the AI tools. Successfully embedding them into educational contexts requires an understanding of the tools, what they are, and what they can and cannot do. Despite their powerful modelling and description capabilities, these tools have (at least currently) significant issues and limitations (Zhang & Li 2021). As telecommunications policy academics charged with the research-led teaching and supervising both undergraduate and research students, we need to be certain that our graduates are capable of understanding the complexities of current issues in this incredibly dynamic field and applying their learnings appropriately in industry and policy environments. We must be reasonably certain that the grades we assign are based on the students’ own work and understanding, To this end, we engaged in an experiment with the current (Q1 of 2023) version of the AI tool to assess how well it coped with questions on a core and current topic in telecommunications policy education: the effects of access regulation (local loop unbundling) on broadband investment and uptake. We found that while the outputs were well-written and appeared plausible, there were significant systematic errors which, once academics are aware of them, can be exploited to avoid the risk of AI use severely undermining the credibility of the assessments we make of students’ written work, at least for the time being and in respect of the version of chatbot software we used. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Our study reveals seven challenges along three main categories: ethical implications, regulatory gaps, and socio-technical limitations. This study contributes to a better understanding of the challenges in AI assessment so that AI researchers and practitioners can resolve these challenges to move AI assessment forward. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

	abstract = {Public health surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data and is closely integrated with the timely dissemination of information that the public needs to know and upon which the public should act. Public health surveillance is central to modern public health practice by contributing data and information usually through a national notifiable disease reporting system (NNDRS). Although early identification and prediction of future disease trends may be technically feasible, more work is needed to improve accuracy so that policy makers can use these predictions to guide prevention and control efforts. In this article, we review the advantages and limitations of the current NNDRS in most countries, discuss some lessons learned about prevention and control from the first wave of COVID-19, and describe some technological innovations in public health surveillance, including geographic information systems (GIS), spatial modeling, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the digital twin method. We conclude that the technology-driven innovative public health surveillance systems are expected to further improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of case reporting during outbreaks and also enhance feedback and transparency, whereby all stakeholders should receive actionable information on control and be able to limit disease risk earlier than ever before. © 2023 Annual Reviews Inc..

	abstract = {Introduction In January, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a Data Management and Sharing Policy aiming to leverage data collected during NIH-funded research. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that this practice is equally vital for augmenting patient research. In addition, data sharing acts as a necessary safeguard against the introduction of analytical biases. While the pandemic provided an opportunity to curtail critical research issues such as reproducibility and validity through data sharing, this did not materialise in practice and became an example of € Open Data in Appearance Only' (ODIAO). Here, we define ODIAO as the intent of data sharing without the occurrence of actual data sharing (eg, material or digital data transfers). Objective Propose a framework that states the main risks associated with data sharing, systematically present risk mitigation strategies and provide examples through a healthcare lens. Methods This framework was informed by critical aspects of both the Open Data Institute and the NIH's 2023 Data Management and Sharing Policy plan guidelines. Results Through our examination of legal, technical, reputational and commercial categories, we find barriers to data sharing ranging from misinterpretation of General Data Privacy Rule to lack of technical personnel able to execute large data transfers. From this, we deduce that at numerous touchpoints, data sharing is presently too disincentivised to become the norm. Conclusion In order to move towards Open Data, we propose the creation of mechanisms for incentivisation, beginning with recentring data sharing on patient benefits, additional clauses in grant requirements and committees to encourage adherence to data reporting practices.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

On-demand food delivery is a service built on algorithm-based technology known for its precarity and physical risks for couriers. We compare how the on-demand food delivery sector is regulated and its observable effects in two Asia-Pacific cities with contrasting food courier profiles: Melbourne, Australia (international students), and Singapore (citizens, permanent residents). We show how the social construction of food couriers in other policy subsystems (migration, higher education, citizenship) affects debates of their fair treatment in the on-demand food delivery sector. By interrogating the politics of digitally enabled versions of reality, we argue for embracing a design perspective to identify how reforms could be introduced in change-resistant sectors. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic revealed the urgent need for the acceleration of vaccine development worldwide. Rapid vaccine development poses numerous risks for each category of vaccine technology. By using the Risklick artificial intelligence (AI), we estimated the risks associated with all types of COVID-19 vaccine during the early phase of vaccine development. We then performed a postmortem analysis of the probability and the impact matrix calculations by comparing the 2020 prognosis to the contemporary situation. We used the Risklick AI to evaluate the risks and their incidence associated with vaccine development in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis revealed the diversity of risks among vaccine technologies currently used by pharmaceutical companies providing vaccines. This analysis highlighted the current and future potential pitfalls connected to vaccine production during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the Risklick AI appears as an essential tool in vaccine development for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to formally anticipate the risks, and increases the overall performance from the production to the distribution of the vaccines. The Risklick AI could, therefore, be extended to other fields of research and development and represent a novel opportunity in the calculation of production-associated risks.

	abstract = {In the face of continued global urbanization, cities are challenged to satisfy increasing standards in terms of quality of life, environmental conditions, safety, security, health, economic growth and mobility. The concept of “smart cities” aims at utilising advanced technologies, artificial intelligence and high computational capacity to increase their resilience and improve the services provided to the citizens. Computation-based numerical simulations have been essentially used to estimate the effects of explosion events in urban environments in terms of both structural damage and human casualties. These provide urban planners and decision makers with valuable information for vulnerability assessment and aid developing prevention or mitigation solutions. In this article, we present a framework to generate a 3D large-scale urbanistic finite element model, where the desired geospatial data are extracted from the open-source world map OpenStreetMap. The model is used to simulate blast wave propagation effects in a wide urban area taking into account the reflections at building surfaces via a sophisticated Fluid-Structure interaction technique integrated in the EUROPLEXUS explicit finite element method software. The explosion in the Port of Beirut in Lebanon, which took place on the 4th of August 2020, was remarkable for the large amount of explosive material causing considerable damage to surrounding structures and a high number of deaths and injured. Such characteristics make the event suitable for assessing the performance of the proposed computational approach in a widely exposed (by the blast wave) urban zone. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Smart cities are the future development direction of cities and are a comprehensive expression of the development of the organic life body of cities. The organic life form of a smart city relates to viewing the city as an organic life self-organizing system based on the wholeness and systemic nature of the smart city life form itself, to construct a holistic spatial linkage of the functions and mechanisms of the city life system, and to enhance the overall vitality of the space. This study is based on the literature of “smart city” research in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and the current situation and related themes of smart city research in China are discussed through co-word analysis and cluster analysis using software such as SPSS and VOSviewer, among which there are four themes in co-word cluster analysis, namely, intelligent technology supporting smart city research; research on the integration of the social system of a smart city; research on the top-level strategic design and planning and construction of a smart city; and research on the development, evaluation, and concrete practice of smart city construction. Four conclusions are drawn from the development of smart city research in China: Firstly, smart city research has attracted the attention of multiple disciplines, and the research themes are scattered and integrated across disciplinary systems. Secondly, smart city construction, development rules, and characteristics need to be further explored, and the problems, future trends, and policy support for the modernization of China’s cities and towns have been focused on engineering and technology, with a lack of practical research in non-technical areas such as humanities and ethics. Thirdly, the philosophical humanism and ecological ethics of smart cities need to be systematized, and their construction and development needs to be humanistic, systematic, and comprehensive, thus contributing to the sustainability, livability, ecology, and wisdom of future urban development. Fourthly, the development of the smart city system is supported by theories related to global cities and innovative cities, and the world city, a product of globalization, is undergoing a transformation into a digital and intelligent organic urban life form. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {An increasing interest in a healthy lifestyle raises questions about optimal body weight. Evidently, it should be clearly discriminated between the standardised “normal” body weight and individually optimal weight. To this end, the basic principle of personalised medicine “one size does not fit all” has to be applied. Contextually, “normal” but e.g. borderline body mass index might be optimal for one person but apparently suboptimal for another one strongly depending on the individual genetic predisposition, geographic origin, cultural and nutritional habits and relevant lifestyle parameters—all included into comprehensive individual patient profile. Even if only slightly deviant, both overweight and underweight are acknowledged risk factors for a shifted metabolism which, if being not optimised, may strongly contribute to the development and progression of severe pathologies. Development of innovative screening programmes is essential to promote population health by application of health risks assessment, individualised patient profiling and multi-parametric analysis, further used for cost-effective targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. The following healthcare areas are considered to be potentially strongly benefiting from the above proposed measures: suboptimal health conditions, sports medicine, stress overload and associated complications, planned pregnancies, periodontal health and dentistry, sleep medicine, eye health and disorders, inflammatory disorders, healing and pain management, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancers, psychiatric and neurologic disorders, stroke of known and unknown aetiology, improved individual and population outcomes under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. In a long-term way, a significantly improved healthcare economy is one of benefits of the proposed paradigm shift from reactive to Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (PPPM/3PM). A tight collaboration between all stakeholders including scientific community, healthcare givers, patient organisations, policy-makers and educators is essential for the smooth implementation of 3PM concepts in daily practice. © 2021, The Author(s).},

This community will be founded on the principles of open innovation and human dignity to address some of the most salient safety issues of modern-day internet, including online harassment, sexual solicitation, and the mental health of vulnerable internet users, particularly adolescents and young adults. We will partner with Mozilla Research Foundation to launch a new open project named "MOSafely.org,"which will serve as a platform for code library, research, and data contributions that support the mission of internet safety. During the workshop, we will discuss: 1) the types of contributions and technical standards needed to advance the state-of-the art in online risk detection, 2) the practical, legal, and ethical challenges that we will face, and 3) ways in which we can overcome these challenges through the use of HCAI to create a sustainable community. An end goal of creating the MOSafely community is to offer evidence-based, customizable, robust, and low-cost technologies that are accessible to the public for youth protection. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {John Last defined epidemiology as “The study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems.” It underscores that epidemiologists are not concerned only with disease but with health-related events, and that ultimately epidemiology is committed to control of disease. Initially focused on the disease, the objects of investigation in epidemiology now correspond to any factor that may influence the state of health of the human being, i.e., biological, clinical factors, in relation to the physical, mental, and social environment. Regardless of the field considered and the type of epidemiology (clinical or population based) referred to, the basic brick of epidemiology remains the data. The data must be as valid and precise as possible to ensure validity and reliability of results. The use of artificial intelligence and its methods can occur at different levels and in several areas of epidemiology. At present, we can consider three main use cases. First, AI can add to a long tradition of using more or less sophisticated observational data analysis methods. It has a role to play in causal inference. Second, AI can intervene at the stage of reconciling and structuring siled and varied data sources. Finally, AI can simply bring new ways of exploring and using data, such as sentiment analysis applied to social media. These three use cases are found, in practice, often intermingled and do not necessarily meet in isolation from each other. The private sector (intermediation platforms) and policy makers are the two other actors involved in the forms that AI uses in epidemiology will take. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Solar energy is the fastest growing source of renewable energy worldwide, and is set to grow at an unprecedented pace for the coming years. Large scale solar energy projects now compete with conventional energy production and offer attractive returns to investors. Solar energy projects have a projected lifetime of over 25 years and while the returns are attractive, investors rarely oversee the risks that impact their Return on Investment (ROI) over the long term. In the wake of increasingly fiercer competition among PV module manufacturers, quality often takes a backseat. In this project, we propose a prognostic solution contrary to existing reactive approaches. We develop a data-driven decision support system (DSS) for technical derisking of utility scale solar energy projects. This system can provide project stakeholders insight into risks associated to different manufacturers. The system is based on data gathered by Sinovoltaics Group, a leading solar quality assurance company with 10+ years of experience. Using information extraction algorithms, useful data is extracted from a large number of quality assurance reports from Sinovoltaics Group, compiled in a database and analyzed for risk assessment leading to a DSS. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Immunization directly impacts health (SDG3) and brings a contribution to 14 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as ending poverty, reducing hunger, and reducing inequalities. Therefore, immunization is recognized to play a central role in reaching the SDGs, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite continuous interventions to strengthen immunization systems and to adequately respond to emergency immunization during epidemics, the immunization-related indicators for SDG3 lag behind in sub-Saharan Africa. Especially taking into account the current Covid19 pandemic, the current performance on the connected SDGs is both a cause and a result of this. Methods: We conduct a literature review through a keyword search strategy complemented with handpicking and snowballing from earlier reviews. After title and abstract screening, we conducted a qualitative analysis of key insights and categorized them according to showing the impact of immunization on SDGs, sustainability challenges, and model-based solutions to these challenges. Results: We reveal the leveraging mechanisms triggered by immunization and position them vis-à-vis the SDGs, within the framework of Public Health and Planetary Health. Several challenges for sustainable control of vaccine-preventable diseases are identified: access to immunization services, global vaccine availability to LMICs, context-dependent vaccine effectiveness, safe and affordable vaccines, local/regional vaccine production, public-private partnerships, and immunization capacity/capability building. Model-based approaches that support SDG-promoting interventions concerning immunization systems are analyzed in light of the strategic priorities of the Immunization Agenda 2030. Conclusions: In general terms, it can be concluded that relevant future research requires (i) design for system resilience, (ii) transdisciplinary modeling, (iii) connecting interventions in immunization with SDG outcomes, (iv) designing interventions and their implementation simultaneously, (v) offering tailored solutions, and (vi) model coordination and integration of services and partnerships. The research and health community is called upon to join forces to activate existing knowledge, generate new insights and develop decision-supporting tools for Low-and Middle-Income Countries’ health authorities and communities to leverage immunization in its transformational role toward successfully meeting the SDGs in 2030. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The potential contribution of artificial intelligence to public health is made up, in a sense, of its many specific contributions to each of the medical disciplines, in that each individual contribution will help to improve the health of the population by making more efficient use of the resources of the healthcare system and improving individual health. There are, however, a few specific areas of public health and social medicine in which AI could bring about an evolution, or even a revolution. This may be the case for precision public health, which draws on data that is both more varied in nature, such as behavioral data from connected objects, and more precise in temporal and spatial resolution. Public health uses aggregate, often macroscopic, data to make health policy decisions. Such indicators are imperfect; they can be inconsistent or misleading and are often most useful in retrospect, rather than at the desired moment. Evidence-based policy would appear to be more legitimate and robust. AI could also change the way public health systems are organized at various levels. Learning healthcare systems, for example, are designed to adapt more or less autonomously to changing health needs. In any case, the challenges of effectively using AI will arise in public health as elsewhere, and they may even be exacerbated or intensified by the well-known and unresolved tension between individual preferences and collective preferences. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen the initiatives against illicit trades gain significant traction at both national and global levels. A crucial component in this fight is correct assessment of the risks posed by different trades across different regions. To aid in this cause, we provide a risk prediction framework based on Bayesian Belief Networks. It involves the development of a causal model incorporating variables related to the rise/decline of the illicit trade volume. The influence of these variables are determined by training on available data that are allowed to update over time. Implementation on a sample case study shows relatively low prediction accuracy of our model. Factors constraining its performance are analyzed and possible ways to avert them are discussed. We expect this framework to act as a decision support tool to the policymakers and strengthen them in the fight against illicit trades. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {As the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled tools is realized across diverse clinical environments, there is a growing understanding of the need for ongoing monitoring and updating of prediction models. Dataset shift—temporal changes in clinical practice, patient populations, and information systems—is now well-documented as a source of deteriorating model accuracy and a challenge to the sustainability of AI-enabled tools in clinical care. While best practices are well-established for training and validating new models, there has been limited work developing best practices for prospective validation and model maintenance. In this paper, we highlight the need for updating clinical prediction models and discuss open questions regarding this critical aspect of the AI modeling lifecycle in three focus areas: model maintenance policies, performance monitoring perspectives, and model updating strategies. With the increasing adoption of AI-enabled tools, the need for such best practices must be addressed and incorporated into new and existing implementations. This commentary aims to encourage conversation and motivate additional research across clinical and data science stakeholders. 2022 Davis, Walsh and Matheny.},

	abstract = {The effects of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market are matters of great social concern. Economists and technology experts are debating at what rate, and to what extent, technology could be used to replace humans in occupations, and what actions could mitigate the unemployment that would result. To this end, it is important to predict which jobs could be automated in the future and what workers could do to move to occupations at lower risk of automation. Here, we calculate the automation risk of almost 1000 existing occupations by quantitatively assessing to what extent robotics and AI abilities can replace human abilities required for those jobs. Furthermore, we introduce a method to find, for any occupation, alternatives that maximize the reduction in automation risk while minimizing the retraining effort. We apply the method to the U.S. workforce composition and show that it could substantially reduce the workers’ automation risk, while the associated retraining effort would be moderate. Governments could use the proposed method to evaluate the unemployment risk of their populations and to adjust educational policies. Robotics companies could use it as a tool to better understand market needs, and members of the public could use it to identify the easiest route to reposition themselves on the job market. © 2022 The Authors, some rights reserved;},

This is a new Clinical Risk Management model capable of developing the ability to observe and synthesize different elements in ways that lead to in-depth interventions to achieve solutions aligned with the sustainable development of health services. In order to avoid uncontrolled decision-making related to the use of enabling technologies, we devised an internal Learning Algorithm Risk Management (LARM) level based on a Bayesian approach. Moreover, according to the ethics of Job Well Done, the SCRM, instead of giving an opinion on events that have already occurred, proposes a bioethical co-working because it suggests the best way to act from a scientific point of view. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: With the availability of extensive health data, artificial intelligence has an inordinate capability to expedite medical explorations and revamp healthcare.Artificial intelligence is set to reform the practice of medicine soon. Despite the mammoth advantages of artificial intelligence in the medical field, there exists inconsistency in the ethical and legal framework for the application of AI in healthcare. Although research has been conducted by various medical disciplines investigating the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in the healthcare setting, the literature lacks a holistic approach. Objective: The purpose of this review is to ascertain the ethical concerns of AI applications in healthcare, to identify the knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for an ethical and legal framework. Methodology: Electronic databases Pub Med and Google Scholar were extensively searched based on the search strategy pertaining to the purpose of this review. Further screening of the included articles was done on the grounds of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The search yielded a total of 1238 articles, out of which 16 articles were identified to be eligible for this review. The selection was strictly based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned in the manuscript. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence (AI) is an exceedingly puissant technology, with the prospect of advancing medical practice in the years to come. Nevertheless, AI brings with it a colossally abundant number of ethical and legal problems associated with its application in healthcare. There are manifold stakeholders in the legal and ethical issues revolving around AI and medicine. Thus, a multifaceted approach involving policymakers, developers, healthcare providers and patients is crucial to arrive at a feasible solution for mitigating the legal and ethical problems pertaining to AI in healthcare. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of learning individualized dose intervals using observational data. There are very few previous works for policy learning with continuous treatment, and all of them focused on recommending an optimal dose rather than an optimal dose interval. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate such an optimal dose interval, named probability dose interval (PDI). The potential outcomes for doses in the PDI are guaranteed better than a pre-specified threshold with a given probability (e.g., 50%). The associated nonconvex optimization problem can be efficiently solved by the Difference-of-Convex functions (DC) algorithm. We prove that our estimated policy is consistent, and its risk converges to that of the best-in-class policy at a root-n rate. Numerical simulations show the advantage of the proposed method over outcome modeling based benchmarks. We further demonstrate the performance of our method in determining individualized Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control intervals for elderly patients with diabetes. Copyright © 2022 by the author(s)},

	abstract = {Discourse surrounding the future of work often treats technological substitution of workers as a cause for concern, but complementarity as a good. However, while automation and artificial intelligence may improve productivity or wages for those who remain employed, they may also have mixed or negative impacts on worker well-being. This study considers five hypothetical channels through which automation may impact worker well-being: influencing worker freedom, sense of meaning, cognitive load, external monitoring, and insecurity. We apply a measure of automation risk to a set of 402 occupations to assess whether automation predicts impacts on worker well-being along the dimensions of job satisfaction, stress, health, and insecurity. Findings based on a 2002–2018 dataset from the General Social Survey reveal that workers facing automation risk appear to experience less stress, but also worse health, and minimal or negative impacts on job satisfaction. These impacts are more concentrated on workers facing the highest levels of automation risk. This article encourages new research directions by revealing important heterogeneous effects of technological complementarity. We recommend that firms, policymakers, and researchers not conceive of technological complementarity as a uniform good, and instead direct more attention to mixed well-being impacts of automation and artificial intelligence on workers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Information generated by these models can then be applied to inform public health practices and mitigate risk. To provide useful and actionable preparedness information to administrators and policy makers, epidemiological models must be formulated to model highly localized environments such as office buildings, campuses, or long-term care facilities. In this paper, a highly configurable agent-based simulation (ABS) framework designed for localized environments is proposed. This ABS provides information about risk and the effects of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, as well as detailed control over the rapidly evolving epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Simulation results can inform decisions made by facility administrators and be used as inputs for a complementary decision support system. The application of our ABS to our research lab environment as a proof of concept demonstrates the configurability and insights achievable with this form of modeling, with future work focused on extensibility and integration with decision support. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {This manuscript aims to construct a decision support tool for the energy policymakers and energy providers to facilitate an analytical decision-making framework where the key drivers, motivators, and barriers are accounted for. The decision support system is designed in the format of a decision tree algorithm, integrating information about the key drivers, motivators, and barriers derived from the results of the ECHOES project and input from decision-makers based on their perceptions regarding the relevance, importance, potential impact, and probability of occurrence for each parameter, in each phase of the process. The input relies on the analysis of 67 in-depth interviews, 15 focus groups, and 12 case studies conducted in seven countries in the energy policy domain. It is exploited to construct patterns, rules, and scenarios as inputs to the decision tree algorithm. The algorithm can be utilized for evaluating the likelihood of success for a particular process or endeavour, conducting scenario analysis concerning various projections of the system under consideration, deciding which projects to prioritize, which schemes to select for implementation, or how to improve the risk management, and assessing the return on the efforts or investments to improve particular key drivers or motivators and alleviate particular barriers. The proposed algorithm also contributes to the alleviation of challenges associated with the exploitation of qualitative data for energy-related decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Emergency department visits (EDV) are common among older adults with and without dementia. The risk factors and demands of EDVs for people with dementia have been well studied; however, the association between EDVs and conversion to dementia among people with predementia has not been thoroughly explored. To study the predictive value of EDVs in predementia’s progression to dementia. The baseline predementia cohort registered from September 2015 to August 2017, with longitudinal follow-up in the History-based Artificial Intelligent Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System database, was retrospectively analyzed. The rates of conversion among the different EDVs were compared. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were applied to study the influence of EDVs on progression. Age, education, sex, neuropsychological tests, activities of daily living, neuropsychiatric symptoms, parkinsonism, and multiple vascular risk factors were adjusted for. A total of 512 participants were analyzed, including 339 (66.2%) non-converters and 173 (33.8%) converters with a mean follow-up of 3.3 (range 0.4–6.1) and 2.8 (range 0.5–5.9) years, respectively. Compared to people without EDV (EDV 0), the hazard ratios for conversion to dementia were 3.6, 5.9, and 6.9 in those with EDV once (EDV 1), twice (EDV 2), and more than twice (EDV >2), respectively. In addition, older age, lower education, poorer cognition, poorer ADL performance, and longer follow-up periods also increased the conversion rates. EDVs in the predementia stages highly predict progression to dementia. Therefore, a sound public health as well as primary healthcare system that provide strategies for better management of mental and physical condition might help prevention of EDVs among older people in the predementia stages. © 2022 Chung et al.

Social networking sites and applications handle a large volume of data. As more personal information flows in and out of social networks, data privacy and security in the social network become a topic of discussion and arguments. This chapter emphasizes data privacy and also differentiates privacy from security. Initial sections of the chapter explain privacy in its elementary form as a need and right of a human being under the perspective of anthropology and behavioral science. Personal data privacy, its current scenario, threats and its protection by law and policymaking by various governments around the world are discussed further. The chapter considers social networking beyond networking sites and applications, and hence a discussion on privacy threats for sensitive data which spread across fields such as health data, forensic, smart toys, image and video surveillance is also analyzed. Positives and negatives of social network’s underlying technologies, like machine learning, artificial intelligence, data sciences, the internet of things and blockchain are discussed in terms of data privacy. The personal data privacy measures imposed by law that need to be incorporated as the part of privacy policies of organizations or that need to be implemented with the support of data security mechanisms are discussed in the last part of the chapter. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

A novel disruptive technology of the 21st century will be 'learner' robots from artificial intelligence systems able to use all the combination of the available knowledge in medical repositories to give the best standard of care.Recent findingsThe autonomy level of robots depends on three factors: the complexity of the task; the environment in which the robot operates, and the required level of human-robot interaction. Autonomous robots in healthcare may be classified in delivery, nurse, and surgical robots. The increasing capability of robots to perform independent actions and complex tasks raises responsibility and accountability issues in a wide variety of application domains. Ethical analyses of these issues are underway and are mostly oriented toward the development of ethical policies requiring a law frame on robotic autonomous behaviors.SummaryAutonomous robots have the potential to improve current medical practice offering a more secure, reliable, and reproducible medicine. Many advancements are required for these new technologies to be fully integrated. Furthermore, the ethical implications of these technologies are yet to be evaluated.

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be one of the important public health concerns globally, and India is among the seven countries with the largest burden of TB. There has been a consistent increase in the notifications of TB cases across the globe. However, the 2018 estimates envisage a gap of about 30% between the incident and notified cases of TB, indicating a significant number of patients who remain undiagnosed or ‘missed’. It is important to understand who is ‘missed’, find this population, and provide quality care. Given these complexities, we reviewed the diagnostic gaps in the care cascade for TB. We searched Medline via PubMed and CENTRAL databases via the Cochrane Library. The search strategy for PubMed was tailored to individual databases and was as: ((((((tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) OR (TB[Title/Abstract])) OR (koch *[Title/Abstract])) OR (“tuberculosis”[MeSH Terms]))) AND (((diagnos *) AND (“diagnosis”[MeSH Terms])))). Furthermore, we screened the references list of the potentially relevant studies to seek additional studies. Studies retrieved from these electronic searches and relevant references included in the bibliography of those studies were reviewed. Original studies in English that assessed the causes of diagnostic gaps and interventions used to address them were included. Delays in diagnosis were found to be attributable to both the individuals’ and the health system’s capacity to diagnose and promptly commence treatment. This review provides insights into the diagnostic gaps in a cascade of care for TB and different interventions adopted in studies to close this gap. The major diagnostic gaps identified in this review are as follows: people may not have access to TB diagnostic tests, individuals are at a higher risk of missed diagnosis, services are available but people may not seek care with a diagnostic facility, and patients are not diagnosed despite reaching health facilities. Therefore, reaching the goal to End TB requires putting in place models and methods to provide prompt and quality assured diagnosis to populations at par. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Regulatory requirements weighing on roboticists are becoming heavier, and at the same time, the activity of producing robots is theorized as creating new types of legal risks. Roboticists become responsible not only for compliance to a set of regulatory objectives, but they also become responsible for giving machines an ability to make decisions in uncertain environments. All of this gives roboticists’ legal literacy a newfound importance, and reveals the lack of data on that population from a socio-legal angle. While we have some knowledge of lawyers’ and policy makers’ concerns for robots, we do not know how roboticists understand their relationship to law and regulation, or the legal value they attribute to various engineering processes. This article offers a preliminary exploration of that population and of their legal concerns, through interviews of ten engineers from Danish robotics companies. The analysis shows that they perceive legal concerns as dependant and integrated into their concerns for safety, which are themselves inferior to functionality and economy concerns. The article further highlights differences in understanding and perception of various legal matters by our informants, and from our practitioner perspective. Hopefully, highlighting these differences will by itself help close the gap between the two professions. © 2022 Léonard Van Rompaey, Robert Jønsson, Kathrine Elmose Jørgensen},

However, robot development and usage in most developing countries remain at an infant stage, robots may increase the likelihood of occupational injuries due to conditions such as limited human capital and defects. By using a city-level dataset based on the Guangdong Province in China, we find that robot application is associated with an increase in the rate of occupational injuries in the first two years, and then exhibits nonsignificant and even negative effects afterwards. We also find that local governments can reduce or even eliminate the effect of robot application on occupational injuries by strengthening safety regulations. In addition, although local governments are keen on pushing robot application and industrial intelligence, the wide application of robots may impose a burden on the public health expenditure of local governments due to occupational injuries. This study extends our knowledge by challenging the traditional view that robot application can reduce the rate of occupational injuries, and also provides suggestions on the safety regulations of developing countries at the early stage of industrial intelligence. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Neural autoregressive sequence models are used to generate sequences in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, where they are evaluated according to sequence-level task losses. These models are typically trained with maximum likelihood estimation, which ignores the task loss, yet empirically performs well as a surrogate objective. Typical approaches to directly optimizing the task loss such as policy gradient and minimum risk training are based around sampling in the sequence space to obtain candidate update directions that are scored based on the loss of a single sequence. In this paper, we develop an alternative method based on random search in the parameter space that leverages access to the maximum likelihood gradient. We propose maximum likelihood guided parameter search (MGS), which samples from a distribution over update directions that is a mixture of random search around the current parameters and around the maximum likelihood gradient, with each direction weighted by its improvement in the task loss. MGS shifts sampling to the parameter space, and scores candidates using losses that are pooled from multiple sequences. Our experiments show that MGS is capable of optimizing sequence-level losses, with substantial reductions in repetition and non-termination in sequence completion, and similar improvements to those of minimum risk training in machine translation. © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Technological advances affect changes in threats and increase the classification of these threats. Covid-19 is a real example of the threat in this era because almost all countries feel its impact. In addition to affecting health, the Covid-19 pandemic also impacts the global economic sector. The economic impact is felt by small and medium industries, goods and services products, and also the tourism sector. The method that is used in this study is a literature review from various national and international journals. AI and Big Data can be used to track viruses in real time, collect adequate public health data, and integrate vaccine use. Also, AI and Big Data can provide local decision and policy-makers with informed, evidence-based predictions. the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases that disrupt public health and have a broad impact must be anticipated and addressed in order to achieve the safety and existence of the nation and state.

	abstract = {This chapter summarizes the argument of the book "Perspectives for Digital Social Innovation to reshape the European Welfare Systems". We consider different and parallel perspectives that can support welfare innovation and namely the rise of information and communication technologies in the public sector, the burgeoning initiatives of social innovation in the welfare sector and social changes challenges to the current welfare settlement. This chapter introduces the terms of the discourse starting from the current debate in EU on new policy trends for social protection and its financing. It discusses nature and effects of digital thinking and connects the long-lasting history of social innovation to its recent interpretation as a complex institutional space that changes "the dominant cognitive frames that frame the social problems". We describe the theoretical implications and the need for multidisciplinary research in a number of fertile areas. Holistic approaches to welfare innovation, emerging digital technologies and the conditions for DSI to produce structural social change need to be studied in depth. Furthermore, the collection reports many situations in which digital social innovations respond to instances in the welfare sector and contribute to the democratic debate with social experiments. Post-hoc analyzes produce interpretative models that will be useful for informing policy decision-making when political agendas are mature. We intended to recreate the lively debate going on in the field of welfare innovation and represent the many "orders of the discourse" a reader may encounter. The innovation of the book itself concerns the logic of presentation of new theories, descriptive models and empirical cases, and the resonance of the subtexts that run through all the chapters. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.

Due to the complexity and stochastically changing prices of emissions, an effective algorithm is needed in these platforms to optimize the use of emissions. By setting an upper bound for buying and a lower bound for selling, such an algorithm can reduce trading risk and ensure the stability of trading platforms. In this study, we developed an automatic emissions permit trading system using a dynamic programming approach with selling and purchasing bounds for transportation firms with non-negligible fixed transaction setup costs. We partially characterize the optimal transportation and permit trading policies by exploiting a new mathematical property that is suitable for a two-dimensional control system. We attempt to elucidate the optimal coordination of permit trading and permit consumption for a transportation firm facing both the Markov price process and random demand during a multi-period planning horizon. We prescribe an optimal trading policy and propose a well-performed heuristic policy and a tight lower bound for the platform. We also show that the easily implemented heuristic policy would not significantly increase emissions. Our findings contribute to the literature and provide guidance to help transportation firms using AI platforms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The demand outstripping supply of mental health resources during the COVID-19 pandemic presents opportunities for digital technology tools to fill this new gap and, in the process, demonstrate capabilities to increase their effectiveness and efficiency. However, technology-enabled services have faced challenges in being sustainably implemented despite showing promising outcomes in efficacy trials since the early 2000s. The ongoing failure of these implementations has been addressed in reconceptualized models and frameworks, along with various efforts to branch out among disparate developers and clinical researchers to provide them with a key for furthering evaluative research. However, the limitations of traditional research methods in dealing with the complexities of mental health care warrant a diversified approach. The crux of the challenges of digital mental health implementation is the efficacy and evaluation of existing studies. Web-based interventions are increasingly used during the pandemic, allowing for affordable access to psychological therapies. However, a lagging infrastructure and skill base has limited the application of digital solutions in mental health care. Methodologies need to be converged owing to the rapid development of digital technologies that have outpaced the evaluation of rigorous digital mental health interventions and strategies to prevent mental illness. The functions and implications of human-computer interaction require a better understanding to overcome engagement barriers, especially with predictive technologies. Explainable artificial intelligence is being incorporated into digital mental health implementation to obtain positive and responsible outcomes. Investment in digital platforms and associated apps for real-time screening, tracking, and treatment offer the promise of cost-effectiveness in vulnerable populations. Although machine learning has been limited by study conduct and reporting methods, the increasing use of unstructured data has strengthened its potential. Early evidence suggests that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of incrementing such technology. The limitations of an evidence-based approach require better integration of decision support tools to guide policymakers with digital mental health implementation. There is a complex range of issues with effectiveness, equity, access, and ethics (eg, privacy, confidentiality, fairness, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability), which warrant resolution. Evidence-informed policies, development of eminent digital products and services, and skills to use and maintain these solutions are required. Studies need to focus on developing digital platforms with explainable artificial intelligence–based apps to enhance resilience and guide the treatment decisions of mental health practitioners. Investments in digital mental health should ensure their safety and workability. End users should encourage the use of innovative methods to encourage developers to effectively evaluate their products and services and to render them a worthwhile investment. Technology-enabled services in a hybrid model of care are most likely to be effective (eg, specialists using these services among vulnerable, at-risk populations but not severe cases of mental ill health). © Luke Balcombe, Diego De Leo.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to showcase the potential and key concerns and risks of artificial intelligence (AI) in the health sector, illustrating its application with current examples, and to provide policy guidance for the development, assessment, and adoption of AI technologies to advance policy objectives. Methods: Nonsystematic scan and analysis of peer-reviewed and gray literature on AI in the health sector, focusing on key insights for policy and governance. Results: The application of AI in the health sector is currently in the early stages. Most applications have not been scaled beyond the research setting. The use in real-world clinical settings is especially nascent, with more evidence in public health, biomedical research, and “back office” administration. Deploying AI in the health sector carries risks and hazards that must be managed proactively by policy makers. For AI to produce positive health and policy outcomes, 5 key areas for policy are proposed, including health data governance, operationalizing AI principles, flexible regulation, skills among health workers and patients, and strategic public investment. Conclusions: AI is not a panacea, but a tool to address specific problems. Its successful development and adoption require data governance that ensures high-quality data are available and secure; relevant actors can access technical infrastructure and resources; regulatory frameworks promote trustworthy AI products; and health workers and patients have the information and skills to use AI products and services safely, effectively, and efficiently. All of this requires considerable investment and international collaboration. © 2021 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Inc.},

	abstract = {Allergy has been recognized as a full specialty in France since 2017 and interest in the field of anaphylaxis has been increasing over the last decade reflecting in the attempt of gathering deeper knowledge on pathomechanism and understanding of potential risk factors in order to provide quality of care of patients, and prevent new episodes and avoidable deaths. Tacking patients and populations at risk is key to strengthen health policies, preventive and public health actions in the national, regional and international levels. For this reason, we here propose a snapshot of ongoing health policies, advocacy actions and research perspectives of anaphylaxis in France in order to tailor optimised actions in the coming years of the French Allergy Society, through the Anaphylaxis working group, in collaboration with the WHO Montpellier Collaborating Centre. We here propose an action plan based on national advances, alignment with international perspectives and promotion of research. The French Allergy Society should move forward with the organization of the ANAFIL network and optimisation of actions to bridge the unmet needs in the field of anaphylaxis. Multiple problems still exist in the management of patients with anaphylaxis: some are medical with a paucity of trained allergists and health professionals, delay in referrals, incorrect labelling of patients, create care channels from emergencies, improve staff training in schools, raise awareness among public authorities, set up a register of the most serious cases, deaths at any age, distribute recommendations to emergency physicians. Many are social and ethical such as the ranging from lack of awareness, poor food labelling, failing supplies of functioning auto-injectable adrenaline injectors as well as unwillingness of patients to carry and use them. Certainly, an improvement on the current situation is needed. We strongly believe that this document can provide the clues to tracked and collaborative actions in the years to come to improve the quality of care of patients suffering from anaphylaxis in France. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS},

The elderly represent more than 20% of the total population in European countries, for whom mobility and accessibility limitations remain key aspects to be solved. This research establishes an accessibility assessment model for social housing, conceived as a decision support system that contributes towards the diagnosis of the main risks and the selection of optimal actions for the adaptation of multi-family buildings. This system also provides a specific technical inspection tool to verify the fulfilment of accessibility regulations. The novelty of the proposed model involves weighting mechanisms for the quantification of action suitability through 3 main indices: Appropriateness, Priority, and Feasibility. These indices are quantitatively and qualitatively valued from technical and socio-economic perspectives. The operation is applied and tested in representative multi-family buildings from southern Europe, which attains 90% of non-compliances and risks, and displays an innovative decision-making outline for owners, promoters, and policy-makers. The conclusions drawn include key outcomes for technicians and users, by providing mechanisms that promote efficient renovation proposals regarding accessibility in social housing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The growing interest comes from decision makers of both the industry and policy domains, searching for applications to increase companies’ profitability, raise efficiency and facilitate the energy transition. This paper aims to provide a novel three-dimensional (3D) indicator for AI applications in the energy sector, based on their respective maturity level, regulatory risks and potential benefits. Case studies are used to exemplify the application of the 3D indicator, showcasing how the developed framework can be used to filter promising AI applications eligible for governmental funding or business development. In addition, the 3D indicator is used to rank AI applications considering different stakeholder preferences (risk-avoidance, profit-seeking, balanced). These results allow AI applications to be better categorised in the face of rapidly emerging national and intergovernmental AI strategies and regulations that constrain the use of AI applications in critical infrastructures. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Five years ago, the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF) conducted an assessment of the challenges and opportunities facing the melanoma research community and patients with melanoma. Since then, remarkable progress has been made on both the basic and clinical research fronts. However, the incidence, recurrence, and death rates for melanoma remain unacceptably high and significant challenges remain. Hence, the MRF Scientific Advisory Council and Breakthrough Consortium, a group that includes clinicians and scientists, reconvened to facilitate intensive discussions on thematic areas essential to melanoma researchers and patients alike, prevention, detection, diagnosis, metastatic dormancy and progression, response and resistance to targeted and immune-based therapy, and the clinical consequences of COVID-19 for patients with melanoma and providers. These extensive discussions helped to crystalize our understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the broader melanoma community today.

	abstract = {Algorithms are increasingly used in different domains of public policy. They help humans to profile unemployed, support administrations to detect tax fraud and give recidivism risk scores that judges or criminal justice managers take into account when they make bail decisions. In recent years, critics have increasingly pointed to ethical challenges of these tools and emphasized problems of discrimination, opaqueness or accountability, and computer scientists have proposed technical solutions to these issues. In contrast to these important debates, the literature on how these tools are implemented in the actual everyday decision-making process has remained cursory. This is problematic because the consequences of ADM systems are at least as dependent on the implementation in an actual decision-making context as on their technical features. In this study, we show how the introduction of risk assessment tools in the criminal justice sector on the local level in the USA has deeply transformed the decision-making process. We argue that this is mainly due to the fact that the evidence generated by the algorithm introduces a notion of statistical prediction to a situation which was dominated by fundamental uncertainty about the outcome before. While this expectation is supported by the case study evidence, the possibility to shift blame to the algorithm does seem much less important to the criminal justice actors. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Changes in demand patterns and unexpected events are the two primary sources of delays in healthcare emergency operations. To mitigate such delays, researchers proposed the movement of idle ambulances between emergency bases as one of the effective ways to improve the areal coverage of future demands. In this study, we have developed a model-driven decision support system that simultaneously seeks to maximize demand coverage while minimizing travel time by optimally relocating emergency response vehicles. The developed mathematical model partitions and prioritizes demand into four categories and continuously updates them over time. Furthermore, it dynamically calculates the number of coverages in different regions based on the current location of idle ambulances. Also, we developed a real-time risk assessment DSS for recommended relocations, which could be utilized as a reference by the EMS user while implementing suggested relocation decisions. A real case study is used to validate the proposed DSS, and its final output is compared to the existing operational policy. The findings show that the average workload added to each ambulance due to relocations has significantly improved the response time and coverage ratio. Compared to the existing operational policy, the developed decision support system decreased the time to respond to calls, which was deemed to be more than to offsets the increase in travel time due to relocation. Furthermore, the system also reduced the total working time of all ambulances by about 9% per shift. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by heterogeneity in susceptibility to the disease and severity of illness. Understanding inter-individual variation has important implications for not only allocation of resources but also targeting patients for escalation of care, inclusion in clinical trials, and individualized medical therapy including vaccination. In addition to geographic location and social vulnerability, there are clear biological differences such as age, sex, race, presence of comorbidities, underlying genetic variation, and differential immune response that contribute to variability in disease manifestation. These differences may have implications for precision medicine. Specific examples include the observation that androgens regulate the expression of the enzyme transmembrane protease, serine 2 which facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral entry into the cell; therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is being explored as a treatment option in males infected with COVID-19. An immunophenotyping study of COVID-19 patients has shown that a subset develop T cytopenia which has prompted a clinical trial that is testing the efficacy of interleukin-7 in these patients. Predicting which COVID-19 patients will develop progressive disease that will require hospitalization has important implications for clinical trials that target outpatients. Enrollment of patients at low risk for progression of disease and hospitalization would likely not result in such therapy demonstrating efficacy. There are efforts to use artificial intelligence to integrate digital data from smartwatch applications or digital monitoring systems and biological data to enable identification of the high risk COVID-19 patient. The ultimate goal of precision medicine using such modern technology is to recognize individual differences to improve health for all. © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research},

	abstract = {This epidemiological study aimed to develop an X-AI that could explain groups with a high anxiety disorder risk in old age. To achieve this objective, (1) this study explored the predictors of senile anxiety using base models and meta models. (2) This study presented decision tree visualization that could help psychiatric consultants and primary physicians easily interpret the path of predicting high-risk groups based on major predictors derived from final machine learning models with the best performance. This study analyzed 1558 elderly (695 males and 863 females) who were 60 years or older and completed the Zung’s Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). We used support vector machine (SVM), random forest, LightGBM, and Adaboost for the base model, a single predictive model, while using XGBoost algorithm for the meta model. The analysis results confirmed that the predictive performance of the “SVM + Random forest + LightGBM + AdaBoost + XGBoost model (stacking ensemble: accuracy 87.4%, precision 85.1%, recall 87.4%, and F1-score 85.5%)” was the best. Also, the results of this study showed that the elderly who often (or mostly) felt subjective loneliness, had a Self Esteem Scale score of 26 or less, and had a subjective communication with their family of 4 or less (on a 10-point scale) were the group with the highest risk anxiety disorder. The results of this study imply that it is necessary to establish a community-based mental health policy that can identify elderly groups with high anxiety risks based on multiple risk factors and manage them constantly. © 2021 by the author.

We reviewed epidemic intelligence activities conducted by the organisation from 2017 to 2020, processes used, key results and how lessons learned can be used to strengthen preparedness, early detection and rapid response to outbreaks that may constitute a public health event of international concern. A total of 415 outbreaks were detected and notified to WHO, using both indicator-based and event-based surveillance. Media monitoring contributed to the initial detection of a quarter of all events reported. The most frequent outbreaks detected were vaccine-preventable diseases, followed by food-and-water-borne diseases, vector-borne diseases and viral haemorrhagic fevers. Rapid risk assessments generated evidence and provided the basis for WHO to trigger operational processes to provide rapid support to member states to respond to outbreaks with a potential for international spread. This is crucial in assisting member states in their obligations under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005). Member states in the region require scaled-up support, particularly in preventing recurrent outbreaks of infectious diseases and enhancing their event-based surveillance capacities with automated tools and processes.

	abstract = {In silico (computational) methods continue to evolve as part of a robust 21st century public health strategy in risk assessment, relevant to all sectors of chemical safety including preclinical drug discovery, industrial chemicals testing, food and cosmetics. Alongside in vitro methods as components of intelligent testing and pathway driven strategies, in silico models provide the potential for more human relevant solutions to the use of animals in safety testing and biomedical research. These are often termed ‘New Approach Methodologies’ (NAMs). Some NAMs incorporate the use of ‘big data’, for example the information provided from high throughput or high content in vitro screening assays or ‘omics’ technologies. Big data has increasing relevance to predictive toxicology but must be appropriately defined, particularly with regard to ‘quality vs quantity’. The purpose of this article is to provide a commentary on the progress of in silico human-based research methods within the context of NAMs, as well as discussion of the emerging use of big data with relevance to safety assessment. The current status of in silico methods is discussed, with input from researchers in the field. Scientific and legislative drivers for change are also considered, along with next steps to address challenges in funding and recognition, to achieve regulatory acceptance and uptake within the research community.

	abstract = {Is human or artificial intelligence more conducive to a stable financial system? To answer this question, we compare human and artificial intelligence with respect to several facets of their decision-making behaviour. On that basis, we characterize possibilities and challenges in designing partnerships that combine the strengths of both minds and machines. Leveraging on those insights, we explain how the differences in human and artificial intelligence have driven the usage of new techniques in financial markets, regulation, supervision, and policy-making, and discuss their potential impact on financial stability. Finally, we describe how effective mind-machine partnerships might be able to reduce systemic risks. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of supporting nurses’ clinical decision-making in complex care situations or conducting tasks that are remote from direct patient interaction, such as documentation processes. There has been an increase in the research and development of AI applications for nursing care, but there is a persistent lack of an extensive overview covering the evidence base for promising application scenarios. Objective: This study synthesizes literature on application scenarios for AI in nursing care settings as well as highlights adjacent aspects in the ethical, legal, and social discourse surrounding the application of AI in nursing care. Methods: Following a rapid review design, PubMed, CINAHL, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, Digital Bibliography & Library Project, and Association for Information Systems Library, as well as the libraries of leading AI conferences, were searched in June 2020. Publications of original quantitative and qualitative research, systematic reviews, discussion papers, and essays on the ethical, legal, and social implications published in English were included. Eligible studies were analyzed on the basis of predetermined selection criteria. Results: The titles and abstracts of 7016 publications and 704 full texts were screened, and 292 publications were included. Hospitals were the most prominent study setting, followed by independent living at home; fewer application scenarios were identified for nursing homes or home care. Most studies used machine learning algorithms, whereas expert or hybrid systems were entailed in less than every 10th publication. The application context of focusing on image and signal processing with tracking, monitoring, or the classification of activity and health followed by care coordination and communication, as well as fall detection, was the main purpose of AI applications. Few studies have reported the effects of AI applications on clinical or organizational outcomes, lacking particularly in data gathered outside laboratory conditions. In addition to technological requirements, the reporting and inclusion of certain requirements capture more overarching topics, such as data privacy, safety, and technology acceptance. Ethical, legal, and social implications reflect the discourse on technology use in health care but have mostly not been discussed in meaningful and potentially encompassing detail. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential for the application of AI systems in different nursing care settings. Considering the lack of findings on the effectiveness and application of AI systems in real-world scenarios, future research should reflect on a more nursing care–specific perspective toward objectives, outcomes, and benefits. We identify that, crucially, an advancement in technological-societal discourse that surrounds the ethical and legal implications of AI applications in nursing care is a necessary next step. Further, we outline the need for greater participation among all of the stakeholders involved. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {First two decades of the twenty-first century are characterised by epidemics of non-communicable diseases such as many hundreds of millions of patients diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases and the type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast, lung, liver and prostate malignancies, neurological, sleep, mood and eye disorders, amongst others. Consequent socio-economic burden is tremendous. Unprecedented decrease in age of maladaptive individuals has been reported. The absolute majority of expanding non-communicable disorders carry a chronic character, over a couple of years progressing from reversible suboptimal health conditions to irreversible severe pathologies and cascading collateral complications. The time-frame between onset of SHS and clinical manifestation of associated disorders is the operational area for an application of reliable risk assessment tools and predictive diagnostics followed by the cost-effective targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. This article demonstrates advanced strategies in bio/medical sciences and healthcare focused on suboptimal health conditions in the frame-work of Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (3PM/PPPM). Potential benefits in healthcare systems and for society at large include but are not restricted to an improved life-quality of major populations and socio-economical groups, advanced professionalism of healthcare-givers and sustainable healthcare economy. Amongst others, following medical areas are proposed to strongly benefit from PPPM strategies applied to the identification and treatment of suboptimal health conditions:Stress overload associated pathologiesMale and female healthPlanned pregnanciesPeriodontal healthEye disordersInflammatory disorders, wound healing and pain management with associated complicationsMetabolic disorders and suboptimal body weightCardiovascular pathologiesCancersStroke, particularly of unknown aetiology and in young individualsSleep medicineSports medicineImproved individual outcomes under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. © 2021, The Author(s).},

In recent years, different credit risk assessment services arose, providing Social Lending platforms to connect lenders and borrowers in a direct way without assisting of financial institutions. Despite the pros of these platforms in supporting fundraising process, there are different stems from multiple factors including lack of experience of lenders, missing or uncertain information about the borrower's credit history. In order to handle these problems, credit risk assessments of financial transactions are usually modeled as a binary problem based on debt repayment, going to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The paper represents an extended abstract of a recent work, where some of the authors performed a benchmarking among the most used credit risk assessment ML models in the field of predicting whether a loan will be repaid in a P2P platform. The experimental analysis is based on a real dataset of Social Lending (Lending Club), going to evaluate several evaluation metrics including AUC, sensitivity, specificity and explainability of the models. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

	abstract = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has emerged as a global pandemic since late 2019 and has affected all forms of human life and economic developments. Various techniques are used to collect the infected patients’ sample, which carries risks of transferring the infection to others. The current study proposes an AI‐powered UAV‐based sample collection procedure through self‐col-lection kits delivery to the potential patients and bringing the samples back for testing. Using a hypothetical case study of Islamabad, Pakistan, various test cases are run where the UAVs paths are optimized using four key algorithms, greedy, intra‐route, inter‐route, and tabu, to save time and reduce carbon emissions associated with alternate transportation methods. Four cases with 30, 50, 100, and 500 patients are investigated for delivering the self‐testing kits to the patients. The results show that the Tabu algorithm provides the best‐optimized paths covering 31.85, 51.35, 85, and 349.15 km distance for different numbers of patients. In addition, the algorithms optimize the number of UAVs to be used in each case and address the studied cases patients with 5, 8, 14, and 71 UAVs, respectively. The current study provides the first step towards the practical handling of COVID‐19 and other pandemics in developing countries, where the risks of spreading the infections can be minimized by reducing person‐to‐person contact. Furthermore, the reduced carbon foot-prints of these UAVs are an added advantage for developing countries that struggle to control such emissions. The proposed system is equally applicable to both developed and developing countries and can help reduce the spread of COVID‐19 through minimizing the person‐to‐person contact, thus helping the transformation of healthcare to smart healthcare. © 2021 by the authors.},

Systems assessing chest radiographs, pathology slides, and early warning systems embedded in electronic health records (EHRs) are becoming ubiquitous in medical practice. Despite this, medical students have minimal exposure to the concepts necessary to utilize and evaluate AI systems, leaving them under prepared for future clinical practice. We must work quickly to bolster undergraduate medical education around AI to remedy this. In this commentary, we propose that medical educators treat AI as a critical component of medical practice that is introduced early and integrated with the other core components of medical school curricula.

	abstract = {Since 2019, COVID-19 has seriously affected many industries of the economy. It is a major emergency risk event, which has caused a huge impact on all kinds of projects implemented by engineering enterprises. Nowadays, more and more engineering have introduced ecological concepts and achieved remarkable results in the fields of energy conservation, environmental protection, and renewable energy utilization. In the current global situation, how to improve the sustainable development of intelligent engineering has become a new problem. The paper explains the social responsibility connotation of intelligent engineering by using the framework proposed by ISO 26000. It puts forward that the expectations of employees, shareholders, communities, consumers, supply chains, governments, and other stakeholders should be fully taken into account in the whole process of the project. By analyzing the problems of intelligent engineering on social responsibility, it provides some suggestions from the seven core subjects of ISO 26000, such as organizational governance, human rights, labor practices, the environment, fair operating practices, consumer issues, and community involvement and development. © 2022 Weiwei Zhao, Zhou Jiang, Xia Liu and Jingshu Zhang, Xiongfei Ji, Ning Gan.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence technology has made Internet finance a brand new development model in the new era. As an emerging financial format, Internet finance plays an important role in providing people with convenient and efficient services. However, due to the late start in this regard and the imperfect related policies and regulations, China is currently still in the development stage, resulting in its risk management system not being mature and complete and lacking uniformity. There are also many regulatory deficiencies, which are not conducive to the healthy, stable, and continuous growth and progress of Internet finance. In the new situation, it is of great significance to strengthen the research on the security of China's Internet finance. Therefore, how to effectively manage Internet financial risks in the context of big data and artificial intelligence has become a topic of research. This study uses questionnaire analysis and data analysis to understand the distribution of risks and the importance of risk response measures through questionnaire surveys. According to the survey results, in the eyes of most interviewees, the ratios of operational risk, credit risk, platform operation risk, and lack of law and reputation risk in high-risk areas are 0.15, 0.3, 0.29, 0.51, and 0.1, respectively. The risks of these first-level indicators need to be particularly important and need to be effectively avoided to manage Internet financial risks. In addition, the most important risk response measures are the construction of information security, followed by the improvement of relevant laws and regulations. In their view, only from these aspects can we effectively control risks internally and externally. © 2022 Na Wang and Kai Wang.},

In the cardiovascular field, AI holds the potential to fulfil many unsolved challenges, eventually translating into improved patient care. In particular, AI appears as the most promising tool to overcome the gap between ever-increasing data-rich technologies and their practical implementation in cardiovascular research, in the cardiologist routine, in the patient daily life and at the healthcare-policy level. A multiplicity of AI technologies is progressively pervading several aspects of precision cardiovascular medicine including early diagnosis, automated imaging processing and interpretation, disease sub-phenotyping, risk prediction and remote monitoring systems. Several methodological, logistical, educational, and ethical challenges are emerging by integrating AI systems at any stage of cardiovascular medicine. This review will discuss the basics of AI methods, the growing body of evidence supporting the role of AI in the cardiovascular field and the challenges to overcome for an effective AI-integrated cardiovascular medicine. © 2022 The authors.},

New tools are needed to assist environmental managers in developing sustainable solutions to these problems, given the nonpoint source nature of salt loads to surface water and groundwater from irrigated agriculture. Equity issues arise in distributing responsibility and costs to the generators of this source of pollution. This paper describes an alternative approach to salt regulation and control using the concept of “Real-Time Water Quality management”. The approach relies on a continually updateable WARMF (Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework) forecasting model to provide daily estimates of salt load assimilative capacity in the San Joaquin River and assessments of compliance with salinity concentration objectives at key monitoring sites on the river. The results of the study showed that the policy combination of well-crafted river salinity objectives by the regulator and the application of an easy-to use and maintain decision support tool by stakeholders have succeeded in minimizing water quality (salinity) exceedances over a 20-year study period. © 2022 by the authors.},

At the same time lockdowns appeared to be less effective than they were earlier in the pandemic. In this paper we argue that one contributing factor is that existing ways of communicating risk—case numbers, test positivity rates, hospitalisations etc.—are difficult for individuals to translate into a level of personal risk, thereby limiting the ability of individuals to properly calibrate their own behaviour. We propose an new more direct measure of personal risk, exposure risk, to estimate the likelihood that an individual will come into contact with an infected person, and we argue that it can play an important role, alongside more conventional statistics, to help translate complex epidemiological data into a simple measure to guide pandemic behaviour. We describe how exposure risk can be calculated using existing data and infection prediction models, and use it to evaluate and compare the exposure risk associated with 39 European countries. © Copyright © 2021 Smyth.},

	abstract = {Integration of digital technologies and public health (or digital healthcare) helps us to fight the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is the biggest public health crisis humanity has faced since the 1918 Influenza Pandemic. In order to better understand the digital healthcare, this work conducted a systematic and comprehensive review of digital healthcare, with the purpose of helping us combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper covers the background information and research overview of digital healthcare, summarizes its applications and challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally puts forward the prospects of digital healthcare. First, main concepts, key development processes, and common application scenarios of integrating digital technologies and digital healthcare were offered in the part of background information. Second, the bibliometric techniques were used to analyze the research output, geographic distribution, discipline distribution, collaboration network, and hot topics of digital healthcare before and after COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated research on the integration of digital technologies and healthcare. Third, application cases of China, EU and U.S using digital technologies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and analyzed. Among these digital technologies, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 5G are most effective weapons to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Applications cases show that these technologies play an irreplaceable role in controlling the spread of the COVID-19. By comparing the application cases in these three regions, we contend that the key to China’s success in avoiding the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is to integrate digital technologies and public health on a large scale without hesitation. Fourth, the application challenges of digital technologies in the public health field are summarized. These challenges mainly come from four aspects: data delays, data fragmentation, privacy security, and data security vulnerabilities. Finally, this study provides the future application prospects of digital healthcare. In addition, we also provide policy recommendations for other countries that use digital technology to combat COVID-19. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {While we continue to wrestle with the immense challenge of implementing equitable access to established evidence-based treatments, substantial gaps remain in our pharmacotherapy armament for common forms of cardiovascular disease including coronary and peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, hypertension, and arrhythmia. We need to continue to invest in the development of new approaches for the discovery, rigorous assessment, and implementation of new therapies. Currently, the time and cost to progress from lead compound/product identification to the clinic, and the success rate in getting there reduces the incentive for industry to invest, despite the enormous burden of disease and potential size of market. There are tremendous opportunities with improved phenotyping of patients currently batched together in syndromic "buckets." Use of advanced imaging and molecular markers may allow stratification of patients in a manner more aligned to biological mechanisms that can, in turn, be targeted by specific approaches developed using high-throughput molecular technologies. Unbiased "omic" approaches enhance the possibility of discovering completely new mechanisms in such groups. Furthermore, advances in drug discovery platforms, and models to study efficacy and toxicity more relevant to the human disease, are valuable. Re-imagining the relationships among discovery, translation, evaluation, and implementation will help reverse the trend away from investment in the cardiovascular space, establishing innovative platforms and approaches across the full spectrum of therapeutic development. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Planners and policymakers have been quick to open electronic channels of participation to inform decision-making processes due to the low cost and high potential engagement. This has created an opportunity for subversive groups to amplify their voice, and therefore influence, in land development and planning processes using automated social media accounts. While scholars have begun to examine how social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have been used to manipulate political discourse, no research has considered the potential damage that such manipulation can and does cause in the local planning context. This study examines the role and potential risk of automated social media accounts in the participatory planning process through an empirical investigation of 21 real estate development projects in the U.S. Using a machine learning model to assess 41,191 relevant Tweets, we found that at least 10% and upwards of 50% of Tweets concerning the various real estate development projects were generated by bots. Automated tweets included critical, neutral, and supportive content demonstrating that social bots represent a range of interests. Planning and public policy professionals will need to develop, apply, and be aware of bot-detection tools and actively promote and build trust through their own digital channels to ensure accurate information is disseminated. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Digital technologies in the workplace have undergone a remarkable evolution in recent years. Biosensors and wearables that enable data collection and analysis, through artificial intelligence (AI) systems became widespread in the working environment, whether private or public. These systems are heavily criticised in the media and in academia, for being used in aggressive algorithmic management contexts. However, they can also be deployed for more legitimate purposes such as occupational safety and health (OSH). Public authorities may promote them as tools for achieving public policy goals of OSH, and public employers may use them for improving employees’ health. Despite these positive aspects, we argue that the deployment of AI systems for OSH raises important issues regarding dual use, chilling effects and employment discrimination. We exemplify how these ethical concerns are raised in three realistic scenarios and elaborate on the legal responses to these issues based on European law. Our analysis highlights blind spots in which laws do not provide clear answers to relevant ethical concerns. We conclude that other avenues should be investigated to help determine whether it is legally and socially acceptable to deploy AI systems and eventually promote such tools as means to achieve the OSH public policy. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Objective: Autonomous cars (ACs) controlled by artificial intelligence are expected to play a significant role in transportation in the near future. This study investigated determinants of trust in ACs. Background: Trust in ACs influences different variables, including the intention to adopt AC technology. Several studies on risk perception have verified that shared value determines trust in risk managers. Previous research has confirmed the effect of value similarity on trust in artificial intelligence. We focused on moral beliefs, specifically utilitarianism (belief in promoting a greater good) and deontology (belief in condemning deliberate harm), and tested the effects of shared moral beliefs on trust in ACs. Method: We conducted three experiments (N = 128, 71, and 196, for each), adopting a thought experiment similar to the well-known trolley problem. We manipulated shared moral beliefs (shared vs. unshared) and driver (AC vs. human), providing participants with different moral dilemma scenarios. Trust in ACs was measured through a questionnaire. Results: The results of Experiment 1 showed that shared utilitarian belief strongly influenced trust in ACs. In Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, however, we did not find statistical evidence that shared deontological belief had an effect on trust in ACs. Conclusion: The results of the three experiments suggest that the effect of shared moral beliefs on trust varies depending on the values that ACs share with humans. Application: To promote AC implementation, policymakers and developers need to understand which values are shared between ACs and humans to enhance trust in ACs. © Copyright 2020, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.},

	abstract = {Keratoconus is a bilateral and asymmetric disease which results in progressive thinning and steeping of the cornea leading to irregular astigmatism and decreased visual acuity. Traditionally, the condition has been described as a noninflammatory disease; however, more recently it has been associated with ocular inflammation. Keratoconus normally develops in the second and third decades of life and progresses until the fourth decade. The condition affects all ethnicities and both sexes. The prevalence and incidence rates of keratoconus have been estimated to be between 0.2 and 4,790 per 100,000 persons and 1.5 and 25 cases per 100,000 persons/year, respectively, with highest rates typically occurring in 20- to 30-year-olds and Middle Eastern and Asian ethnicities. Progressive stromal thinning, rupture of the anterior limiting membrane, and subsequent ectasia of the central/paracentral cornea are the most commonly observed histopathological findings. A family history of keratoconus, eye rubbing, eczema, asthma, and allergy are risk factors for developing keratoconus. Detecting keratoconus in its earliest stages remains a challenge. Corneal topography is the primary diagnostic tool for keratoconus detection. In incipient cases, however, the use of a single parameter to diagnose keratoconus is insufficient, and in addition to corneal topography, corneal pachymetry and higher order aberration data are now commonly used. Keratoconus severity and progression may be classified based on morphological features and disease evolution, ocular signs, and index-based systems. Keratoconus treatment varies depending on disease severity and progression. Mild cases are typically treated with spectacles, moderate cases with contact lenses, while severe cases that cannot be managed with scleral contact lenses may require corneal surgery. Mild to moderate cases of progressive keratoconus may also be treated surgically, most commonly with corneal cross-linking. This article provides an updated review on the definition, epidemiology, histopathology, aetiology and pathogenesis, clinical features, detection, classification, and management and treatment strategies for keratoconus. © 2021 The Authors},

Given accumulating evidence on sex- and gender-based differences in cardiovascular disease development and outcomes, the need for more effective approaches to screening for risk factors and phenotypes in women is ever urgent. Public health surveillance and health care delivery systems now continuously generate massive amounts of data that could be leveraged to enable both screening of cardiovascular risk and implementation of tailored preventive interventions across a woman's life span. However, health care providers, clinical guidelines committees, and health policy experts are not yet sufficiently equipped to optimize the collection of data on women, use or interpret these data, or develop approaches to targeting interventions.

	abstract = {Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has demonstrated high efficiency in academic research, while only few, and predominantly small, real-world AI applications exist in the preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic contexts. Our identification and analysis of success factors for the implementation of AI aims to close the gap between recent years' significant academic AI advancements and the comparably low level of practical application in healthcare. Methods: A literature and real life cases analysis was conducted in Scopus and OpacPlus as well as the Google advanced search database. The according search queries have been defined based on success factor categories for AI implementation derived from a prior World Health Organization survey about barriers of adoption of Big Data within 125 countries. The eligible publications and real life cases were identified through a catalog of in- and exclusion criteria focused on concrete AI application cases. These were then analyzed to deduct and discuss success factors that facilitate or inhibit a broad-scale implementation of AI in healthcare. Results: The analysis revealed three categories of success factors, namely (1) policy setting, (2) technological implementation, and (3) medical and economic impact measurement. For each of them a set of recommendations has been deducted: First, a risk adjusted policy frame is required that distinguishes between precautionary and permissionless principles, and differentiates among accountability, liability, and culpability. Second, a “privacy by design” centered technology infrastructure shall be applied that enables practical and legally compliant data access. Third, the medical and economic impact need to be quantified, e.g., through the measurement of quality-adjusted life years while applying the CHEERS and PRISMA reporting criteria. Conclusions: Private and public institutions can already today leverage AI implementation based on the identified results and thus drive the translation from scientific development to real world application. Additional success factors could include trust-building measures, data categorization guidelines, and risk level assessments and as the success factors are interlinked, future research should elaborate on their optimal interaction to utilize the full potential of AI in real world application. © Copyright © 2021 Wolff, Pauling, Keck and Baumbach.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and continuous in-depth integration with big data, cloud computing, robotics, and the Internet, especially the Internet of Things and blockchain, the reconstruction of society has been accelerated. This process not only enables epidemic prevention and control, economic transformation and growth, social governance reform and upgrading, and improvement in people's well-being but also puts forward many new challenges to social governance. The development of artificial intelligence must require the establishment of ethical standards and systems to be at the same frequency, and the development speed of the two must be coordinated to ensure the healthy development of technology. However, artificial intelligence not only brings convenience to people's lives but also raises people's concerns about its ramifications. To understand the influence of AI on governance in the algorithm dimension, a model of the influence of AI governance is built by using a parallel algorithm. It is necessary to learn new knowledge of social governance in the era of artificial intelligence and establish concomitant new ideas of social governance to explore a new way of social governance in the era of artificial intelligence. The research results show that after the introduction of artificial intelligence embedded governance, the governance level is greatly improved, the problem solving rate is increased by more than 50%, the satisfaction of the masses is increased by 30%, and the governance cost is reduced by 20%. However, people do not know much about the risks of artificial intelligence. Only approximately 10% of the population has a clear understanding of the risks of artificial intelligence. The research results show that artificial intelligence can play an important role in governance, but it is necessary to prevent the risks of artificial intelligence to better promote social development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is required to provide the best treatment to our patients, to prevent the epidemic from spreading in the community, and to reduce costs associated with the aggravation of the disease. We developed a decision tree model to evaluate the impact of using an artificial intelligence-based chest computed tomography (CT) analysis software (icolung, icometrix) to analyze CT scans for the detection and prognosis of COVID-19 cases. The model compared routine practice where patients receiving a chest CT scan were not screened for COVID-19, with a scenario where icolung was introduced to enable COVID-19 diagnosis. The primary outcome was to evaluate the impact of icolung on the transmission of COVID-19 infection, and the secondary outcome was the in-hospital length of stay. Using EUR 20000 as a willingness-to-pay threshold, icolung is cost-effective in reducing the risk of transmission, with a low prevalence of COVID-19 infections. Concerning the hospitalization cost, icolung is cost-effective at a higher value of COVID-19 prevalence and risk of hospitalization. This model provides a framework for the evaluation of AI-based tools for the early detection of COVID-19 cases. It allows for making decisions regarding their implementation in routine practice, considering both costs and effects. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {As AI industry matures, it is important to ensure that the organizations developing these systems have sufficient incentives to identify and mitigate risks and harm. Unfortunately, the profit motive is often misaligned with this goal. Successful work to identify or reduce risk rarely has direct tangible benefits. In this paper, we consider the use of regulatory penalty defaults as a way to counter these perverse incentives. A regulatory penalty default regime consists of two parts: A regulatory penalty default and a mechanism to bargain around the default. The regulatory penalty default induces private actors to research and mitigate potential harms in order to limit liability, making the benefits of risk mitigation tangible. The bargaining mechanism provides incentives for companies to go beyond achieving a prescriptive threshold of compliance in creating a compelling case for escape from the default. With a focus on the policy landscape in the United States, we propose and discuss potential regulatory penalty default regimes for AI systems. For each of our proposals, we also discuss accompanying regulatory pathways for the bargaining process. While regulatory penalty default regimes are not a panacea (we discuss several drawbacks of the proposed methods), they are an important tool to consider in the regulation of AI systems.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is getting popular in the robotics field due to its nature to learn from dynamic environments. However, it is unable to provide explanations of why an output was generated. Explainability becomes therefore important in situations where humans interact with robots, such as in human-robot collaboration (HRC) scenarios. Attempts to address explainability in robotics usually are restricted to explain a specific decision taken by the RL model, but not to understand the complete behavior of the robot. In addition, the explainability methods are restricted to be used by domain experts as queries and responses are not translated to natural language. This work overcomes these limitations by proposing an explainability solution for RL models applied to HRC. It is mainly formed by the adaptation of two methods: (i) Reward decomposition gives an insight into the factors that impacted the robot's choice by decomposing the reward function. It further provides sets of relevant reasons for each decision taken during the robot's operation; (ii) Autonomous policy explanation provides a global explanation of the robot's behavior by answering queries in the form of natural language, thus making understandable to any human user. Experiments in simulated HRC scenarios revealed an increased understanding of the optimal choices made by the robots. Additionally, our solution demonstrated as a powerful debugging tool to find weaknesses in the robot's policy and assist in its improvement.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Those who took part were either civil servants working for the UK government, U.S. Congress, the United Nations, and the European Commission, or cognate members of civil society groups and the private sector. Analysis of interviews identified four major themes: Scepticism; Realism; Influence; and Governance outside of Government. These themes provide evidence for the value of conceptualising the governance of global catastrophic risk as a unified challenge. Furthermore, they highlight the range of agents involved in governance of emerging technology and give reason to value reforms carried out sub-nationally. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: We propose the Lifelog Bigdata Platform as a sustainable digital healthcare system based on individual-centric lifelog da-tasets and describe the standardization of lifelog and clinical data in its full-cycle management system. Materials and Methods: The Lifelog Bigdata Platform was developed by Yonsei Wonju Health System on the cloud to support digital healthcare and precision medicine. It consists of five core components: data acquisition system, de-identification of individual information, lifelog integration, analyzer, and service. We designed a gathering system into a dedicated virtual machine to save life-log or clinical outcomes and established standard guidelines for maintaining the quality of gathering procedures. We used standard integration keys to integrate the lifelog and clinical data. Metadata were generated from the data warehouse after loading combined or fragmented data on it. We analyzed the de-identified lifelog and clinical data using the lifelog analyzer to prevent and manage acute and chronic diseases through providing results of statistics on analysis. Results: The big data centers were built in four hospitals and seven companies for integrating lifelog and clinical data to develop the Lifelog Bigdata Platform. We integrated and loaded lifelog big data and clinical data for 3 years. In the first year, we uploaded 94 types of data on the platform with a total capacity of 221 GB. Conclusion: The Lifelog Bigdata Platform is the first to combine lifelog and clinical data. The proposed standardization guidelines can be used for future platforms to achieve a virtuous cycle structure of lifelogging big data and an industrial ecosystem. © Yonsei University College of Medicine 2022.},

Methods: To that aim, we will conduct a two-armed stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial rolled out to two inpatient hospitals to evaluate whether a machine learning algorithm accurately identifies patients who may benefit from a comprehensive review by a palliative care specialist and decreases time to receiving a palliative care consult in hospital. This is a single-center study which will be conducted from August 2019 to November 2020 at Saint Mary’s Hospital & Methodist Hospital both within Mayo Clinic Rochester in Minnesota. Clusters will be nursing units which will be chosen to be a mix of complex patients from Cardiology, Critical Care, and Oncology and had previously established relationships with palliative medicine. The stepped wedge design will have 12 units allocated to a design matrix of 5 treatment wedges. Each wedge will last 75 days resulting in a study period of 12 months of recruitment unless otherwise specified. Data will be analyzed with Bayesian hierarchical models with credible intervals denoting statistical significance. Discussion: This intervention offers a pragmatic approach to delivering specialty palliative care to hospital patients in need using machine learning, thereby leading to high value care and improved outcomes. It is not enough for AI to be utilized by simply publishing research showing predictive performance; clinical trials demonstrating better outcomes are critically needed. Furthermore, the deployment of an AI algorithm is a complex process that requires multiple teams with varying skill sets. To evaluate a deployed AI, a pragmatic clinical trial can accommodate the difficulties of clinical practice while retaining scientific rigor. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03976297.

	abstract = {The transmission of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can be reduced by implementing a lockdown policy, which has also been proven as an effective control measure for air pollution in the urban cities. In this study, we applied ground- and satellite-based data of five criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO) and meteorological factors from March 8 to May 15, 2020 (before, partial-, and full-lockdown). The generalized additive models (GAMs), wavelet coherence, and random forest (RF) model were employed to explore the relationship between air quality indicators and COVID-19 transmission in Dhaka city. Results show that overall, 26, 20.4, 17.5, 9.7 and 8.8% declined in PM 2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO concentrations, respectively, in Dhaka City during the partial and full lockdown compared to the period before the lockdown. The implementation of lockdown policy for containing COVID-19 transmission played a crucial role in reducing air pollution. The findings of wavelet coherence and partial wavelet coherence demonstrate no standalone coherence, but interestingly, multiple wavelet coherence indicated a strong short-term coherence among air pollutants and meteorological factors with the COVID-19 outbreak. Outcomes of GAMs indicated that an increase of 1-unit in long-term exposure to O3 and CO (lag1) was associated with a 2.9% (95% CI: −0.3%, −5.6%), and 53.9% (95% CI: 0.2%, −107.9%) decreased risk of COVID-19 infection rate during the full-lockdown period. Whereas, COVID-19 infection and MT (mean temperature) are modulated by a peak during full-lockdown, which is mostly attributed to contact transmission in Dhaka city. RF model revealed among the parameters being studied, MT, RH (relative humidity), and O3 were the dominant factors that could be associated with COVID-19 cases during the study period. The outcomes reported here could elucidate the effectiveness of lockdown scenarios for COVID-19 containment and air pollution control in Dhaka city. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer (LC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. In India, the incidence of LC is increasing rapidly, and a majority of the patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease when treatment is less likely to be effective. Recent therapeutic developments have significantly improved survival outcomes in patients with LC. Prompt specialist referral remains critical for early diagnosis for improved patient survival. In the Indian scenario, distinguishing LC from benign and endemic medical conditions such as tuberculosis can pose a challenge. Hence, awareness regarding the red flags—signs and symptoms that warrant further investigations and referral—is vital. This review is an effort toward encouraging general physicians to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion for those at risk of developing LC and assisting them in refering patients with concerning symptoms to specialists or multidisciplinary teams as early as possible. © 2022 Indian Chest Society | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

	abstract = {Routine screening for postpartum depression (PPD) is widespread, yet little attention has been given to the perceived preparedness of health providers to perform screening procedures, or to the role of organizational factors in their preparedness, although these are crucial elements for optimal implementation. The aim of this study was to examine organizational factors associated with public health nurses’ (PHNs) perceived preparedness to screen women for PPD, intervene, and refer them in cases of suspected PPD. Two hundred and nineteen PHNs completed a self-report survey regarding their perceived preparedness to carry out a screening program (including screening, intervening, and referring women), and their perceived organizational support, supervisor’s support, colleagues’ support, and colleagues’ preparedness. A path analysis model was used to analyze the data. The results showed that perceived colleagues’ preparedness was significantly associated with the three perceived preparedness constructs (screen, intervene, and refer). Perceived supervisor’s support was positively associated with perceived preparedness to screen, and perceived organizational support was positively associated with perceived preparedness to intervene. This paper highlights the manner in which formal and informal organizational factors play an important role in the perceived preparedness of PHNs to carry out a PPD screening program, and how these factors impact the three different aspects of the screening program. Organizations implementing PPD screening should support PHNs in all aspects of the implementation process, provide guidance, and enhance peer-group continued learning through which PHNs could share knowledge, discuss barriers, and foster professional development. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: Suicide is a growing public health concern with a global prevalence of approximately 800,000 deaths per year. The current process of evaluating suicide risk is highly subjective, which can limit the efficacy and accuracy of prediction efforts. Consequently, suicide detection strategies are shifting toward artificial intelligence platforms that can identify patterns within ‘big data’ to generate risk algorithms that can determine the effects of risk (and protective) factors on suicide outcomes, predict suicide outbreaks and identify at-risk individuals or populations. In this review, we summarize the role of artificial intelligence in optimizing suicide risk prediction and behavior management. Methods: This paper provides a general review of the literature. A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases with coverage from January 1990 to June 2019. Results were restricted to peer-reviewed, English-language articles. Conference and dissertation proceedings, case reports, protocol papers and opinion pieces were excluded. Reference lists were also examined for additional articles of relevance. Results: At the individual level, prediction analytics help to identify individuals in crisis to intervene with emotional support, crisis and psychoeducational resources, and alerts for emergency assistance. At the population level, algorithms can identify at-risk groups or suicide hotspots, which help inform resource mobilization, policy reform and advocacy efforts. Artificial intelligence has also been used to support the clinical management of suicide across diagnostics and evaluation, medication management and behavioral therapy delivery. There could be several advantages of incorporating artificial intelligence into suicide care, which includes a time- and resource-effective alternative to clinician-based strategies, adaptability to various settings and demographics, and suitability for use in remote locations with limited access to mental healthcare supports. Conclusion: Based on the observed benefits to date, artificial intelligence has a demonstrated utility within suicide prediction and clinical management efforts and will continue to advance mental healthcare forward. © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2019.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be the next big phase in digitalization. There is a global ongoing race to develop, implement and make use of AI in both the private and public sector. The many responsibilities of governments in this race are complicated and cut across a number of areas. Therefore, it is important that the use of AI supports these diverse aspects of governmental commitments and values. The aim of this paper is to analyze how AI is portrayed in Swedish policy documents and what values are attributed to the use of AI. We analyze Swedish policy documents and map benefits, considerations and risks with AI into different value ideals, based on an established e-government value framework. We conclude that there is a discrepancy in the policy level discourse on the use of AI between different value ideals. Our findings show that AI is strongly associated with improving efficiency and service quality in line with previous e-government policy studies. Interestingly, few benefits are highlighted concerning engagement of citizens in policy making. A more nuanced view on AI is needed for creating realistic expectations on how this technology can benefit society. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

SDG#3 deals with “Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks” So, the COVID-19 pandemic can be included within the targets of SDG#11 and #3 targets. It is reiterated the necessity of disaster and emergency health risk reduction and the building of resilience within the context of sustainable development concerns. Resilience is a concept also contemplated within the paradigm of smart planning and smart cities. The urban domain is selected to explore the tools used to cope with the current COVID-19 pandemic and that contribute to building resilience. Innovation and the relevance of SDG#9 are clear since the urgency of improvements in general and domestic technology and access to universal and affordable internet have to be guaranteed to achieve the objective of building resilience. A categorized vision of the main technologies, applications, and functionalities within the Smart City domain are discussed to identify the way those technologies support COVID-19 and integrate with the three SDGs fundamentals for resilience building. We hope that this work will contribute for practitioners, policymakers, academics, and citizens to be better prepared for future outbreaks. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District (EVMWD), like many other water agencies in southern California, relies heavily on imported water supply. The uncertainty associated with reliable imported water supplies due to drought conditions and climate change, and the increasing cost of imported water are areas of concern for EVMWD. Considering these conditions, EVMWD, which serves one of the fastest growing regions within Riverside County, embarked upon the development of its first Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) – a long term strategy for providing reliable water supplies to its growing customer base. The IRP’s evaluation methodology consists of three steps: Identification of potential water supply projects, project evaluation, and recommendation of a water supply portfolio comprised of the specific projects. A System Dynamics (SD) Water Resources Decision Support System (WRDSS) was used to evaluate different scenarios and examine EVMWD’s vulnerability to risks such as water supply shortage, and changes to water quality and/or water demand projections. Even though SD has been extensively applied to many water resources planning modeling efforts, based on our literature review, there is not a documented case of SD modeling applied to an IRP project. The recommended water supply portfolio represents the most cost effective option. It meets the forecasted long term deficit and provides the best reliability while providing good quality water supplies to EVMWD’s customers. The recommended water supply portfolio will be implemented using an adaptive management approach to adjust to changing conditions, coupled with long-range resource management policies that optimize water supply and storage assets in times of both drought and surplus. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Health chatbots are rising in popularity and capability for fighting the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19). Objectives: This study aims to review the current literature on COVID-19 related chatbots in healthcare, identify and characterize these emerging technologies and their applications for combating COVID-19, and describe related challenges. Methods: The authors conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature on COVID-19, guided by the Arksey and O'Malley framework. PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar were searched over a period between January and September 2020 by using the keywords “COVID* chatbot”, “virtual assistant”, “AI enabled platform COVID” and associated synonyms. Relevant studies' references were checked for further articles. The content of these studies was screened and thematically analyzed by the two authors. Results: Out of 543 articles initially identified, 9 were eligible for inclusion. Studies describing chatbots' development and architecture (n=6) were the most common, and only 3 empirical studies on the user experience were identified. Our scoping review identified five key applications of the current health chatbots, which were: disseminating health information and knowledge; self-triage and personal risk assessment; monitoring exposure and notifications; tracking COVID-19 symptoms and health aspects; and combating misinformation and fake news. Furthermore, these technologies can accomplish the following tasks: ask and answer questions; create health records and history of use; complete forms and generate reports; and take simple actions. Nonetheless, the use of health chatbots poses many challenges both at the level of the social system (i.e., consumers' acceptability) as well as the technical system (i.e., design and usability). Conclusion: Using health chatbots to combat COVID-19 is a practice still in its infancy. We believe that our work will help researchers in this domain gain better understanding of this novel technology's design and applications, which are needed for continuous improvement in the health chatbots' functionalities and their usefulness to fight COVID-19. © 2020 Manal Almalki, Fahad Azeez This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {DDoS attack is posing an immense threat to Internet and online businesses. DDoS attack makes an online service unavailable to legitimate users by sending voluminous number of dummy requests or by exploiting some vulnerability or security flaws present in current Internet infrastructure. Information present on Internet needs to be defended against DDoS attack by not only technological means but also with the help of economic means using incentives as a tool. In this paper, we have proposed a model using a network management strategy which involves policies to maintain quality of service (QoS) during a DDoS attack. User must have sending rights in the form of contract to access server. A XML form having different fields on QoS parameters is provided by the service provider which a user has to fill with the help of policies present in policy pool. This XML form is turned into contract after evaluation by the control broker. Policy-based network management (PBNM) is used to execute proposed approach which enables user to have dynamic negotiation with the service provider on the cost and types of resources. Proposed model has been implemented on NS2. Results obtained from simulation show the supremacy of our proposed model. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020},

	abstract = {— Obsolete Electronic and Electrical Equipment (E E E) contain hazardous substances which are a threat to environmental sustain ability and human health. Electronic waste (e-waste) contain minerals worth billions of dollars which, if properly, recovered and managed, can create employment and wealth. While developing countries have recorded double-digit annual growth in Information and Communications Technology (1CT) usage, only a few countries in the subsanaran Africa region have enacted policies that enforce management of e-waste, making e-waste one of the emerging solid waste challenges. Data was collected from 17 Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) which revealed that the majority of the participants had no knowledge of the national e-waste policy. The findings revealed that all of the participants were aware of the effects of e-waste yet more than half did not have approved e-waste policies. The results show that all institutions stored obsolete equipment in their storerooms for a while before disposing of them by auctioning to staff members and the public, while some of the e-waste was disposed of in dumpsites. More than half of the institutions disposed of e-waste as ordinary garbage, while only a tenth took e-waste for recycling and one institution got it collected by e-waste collectors. Institutions were fueling e-waste as more than 80% of the participants preferred to replace obsolete electrical equipment with less than a fifth considered repairing. This study could help policy-makers in enacting institutional and national policies, the establishment of appropriate collection and recycling facilities within institutions and nationally, as well as influence future research. © 2020 IEEE.},

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it has never been more clear that the healthcare needs of the population, and the technical and scientific advances with which to solve them, are rapidly evolving and the medical workforce must adapt to these changes to deliver personalised healthcare. This article considers the current challenges that need to be addressed to deliver a future physician-led healthcare service that works for its patients. Key themes are expanded upon, including the changing healthcare workforce, digital and technological innovation, service delivery, complex conditions and changing patient demographics. The impact and challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on these factors are highlighted. Avenues for development are suggested, both in postgraduate medical training and the health service as a whole. These changes will be required to deliver the physicians of the future, imbued with the skills and attributes they will need to provide a high standard of care in the mid-21st century. © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

	abstract = {Rapid technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as the growing deployment of intelligent technologies in new application domains, have generated serious anxiety and a fear of missing out among different stake-holders, fostering a racing narrative. Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects. © 2020 AI Access Foundation.

	abstract = {The decarbonisation of energy provision is key to managing global greenhouse gas emissions and hence mitigating climate change. Digital technologies such as big data, machine learning, and the Internet of Things are receiving more and more attention as they can aid the decarbonisation process while requiring limited investments. The orchestration of these novel technologies, so-called cyber-physical systems (CPS), provides further, synergetic effects that increase efficiency of energy provision and industrial production, thereby optimising economic feasibility and environmental impact. This comprehensive review article assesses the current as well as the potential impact of digital technologies within CPS on the decarbonisation of energy systems. Ad hoc calculation for selected applications of CPS and its subsystems estimates not only the economic impact but also the emission reduction potential. This assessment clearly shows that digitalisation of energy systems using CPS completely alters the marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) and creates novel pathways for the transition to a low-carbon energy system. Moreover, the assessment concludes that when CPS are combined with artificial intelligence (AI), decarbonisation could potentially progress at an unforeseeable pace while introducing unpredictable and potentially existential risks. Therefore, the impact of intelligent CPS on systemic resilience and energy security is discussed and policy recommendations are deducted. The assessment shows that the potential benefits clearly outweigh the latent risks as long as these are managed by policy makers. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in digital health, as automated systems are being adopted throughout the health care system. Because they are still flexible, emerging technologies can be shaped significantly by media representations as well as public engagement with science. In this context, we examine the belief that negative news media coverage of AI - and specifically, the alleged use of imagery from the movie Terminator - is to blame for public concerns about AI. This belief is identified as a potential barrier to meaningful engagement of AI scientists and technology developers with journalists and the broader public. We name this climate of risk perception the "Terminator Syndrome" - not because of its origins in the movie of the same name per se, but because such unchecked beliefs can terminate broad public engagement on AI before they even begin. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study examined the hypothesis that the news media coverage of AI is negative. We conducted a sentiment analysis of news data spanning over six decades, from 1956 to 2018, using the Google Cloud Natural Language API Sentiment Analysis tool. Contrary to the alleged negative sentiment in news media coverage of AI, we found that the available evidence does not support this claim. We conclude with an innovation policy-relevant discussion on the current state of AI risk perceptions, and what critical social sciences offer for responsible AI innovation in digital health, life sciences, and society. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Many schools closed during the Covid-19 pandemic, and this was also the case in Canada where schooling was seriously disrupted because schools closed for seven months. At the present time, little is known about the extent of the impact of school closures on student learning but it is evident that some educational institutions such as universities and colleges were able to shift to online more easily than others. Globally, those persons who had internet access and tech skills were able to maintain social contacts and work from home. It became evident, however, during the school closures that schools and school systems who had blended learning in place fared better overall because they had systems and processes to fall back on. The uneven levels of technology adoption in the K-12 education sector also became apparent during the school closures. At the time of writing, schools in Canada are planning to re-open to students in September, 2020. School administrators will be challenged to manage pandemic protocols and the predicted learning gaps in students who were at home since March. At the same time, however, technology continues to evolve and change how persons outside schools interact with each other. New technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are changing the day-to-day landscape and schooling needs to continue to adapt and shift to consider how to use these emergent technologies. In this paper, the authors review some of the emergent technologies and concerns that have been raised about them. They suggest that a critical, interdisciplinary approach is needed to assess the affordances and risks of emergent technology and how these technologies might support learners in schools. Given the present rate of technology change, schools will need to build capacity and competence to help them solve the problems of the present and the future. © IMSCI 2020.All right reserved.},

We present a literature review on the extent to which research in this field has developed over the years, and reveal gaps in gender-sensitive awareness between the clinical portrayal and the translation into gender-specific treatment regimens, guidelines and into gender-oriented preventive strategies and health policies. Subsequently, through the lens of gender, we describe these domains in detail for four selected medical conditions: Asthma, obesity and overweight, chronic kidney disease and coronavirus disease 2019. As some of the key gender differences become more apparent during adolescence, we focus on this developmental stage. Finally, we propose a model which is based on three influential issues: (1) Investigating gender-specific medical profiles of related health conditions, rather than a single disease; (2) The dynamics of gender disparities across developmental stages; and (3) An integrative approach which takes into account additional risk factors (ethnicity, socio-demographic variables, minorities, lifestyle habits etc.). Increasing the awareness of gender-specific medicine in daily practice and in tailored guidelines, already among adolescents, may reduce inequities, facilitate the prediction of future trends and properly address the characteristics and needs of certain subpopulations within each gender. © The Author(s) 2020.},

We classify studies according to which exact version of double reading they use, because the evidence suggests that effectiveness of double reading is contingent on whether the two radiologists are blinded to one another's decisions, and how the decisions of the two radiologists are integrated. Finally, we explore the implications for future mammography, including using artificial intelligence as the second reader, and applications to more complex three-dimensional imaging techniques such as tomosynthesis. © 2020 British Institute of Radiology.

	abstract = {Background: Evidence from new health technologies is growing, along with demands for evidence to inform policy decisions, creating challenges in completing health technology assessments (HTAs)/systematic reviews (SRs) in a timely manner. Software can decrease the time and burden by automating the process, but evidence validating such software is limited. We tested the accuracy of RobotReviewer, a semi-autonomous risk of bias (RoB) assessment tool, and its agreement with human reviewers. Methods: Two reviewers independently conducted RoB assessments on a sample of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and their consensus ratings were compared with those generated by RobotReviewer. Agreement with the human reviewers was assessed using percent agreement and weighted kappa (κ). The accuracy of RobotReviewer was also assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve in comparison to the consensus agreement of the human reviewers. Results: The study included 372 RCTs. Inter-rater reliability ranged from κ = −0.06 (no agreement) for blinding of participants and personnel to κ = 0.62 (good agreement) for random sequence generation (excluding overall RoB). RobotReviewer was found to use a high percentage of “irrelevant supporting quotations” to complement RoB assessments for blinding of participants and personnel (72.6%), blinding of outcome assessment (70.4%), and allocation concealment (54.3%). Conclusion: RobotReviewer can help with risk of bias assessment of RCTs but cannot replace human evaluations. Thus, reviewers should check and validate RoB assessments from RobotReviewer by consulting the original article when not relevant supporting quotations are provided by RobotReviewer. This consultation is in line with the recommendation provided by the developers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

As soon as China reported the unidentified outbreak to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019, Taiwan assembled a taskforce and began health checks onboard flights from Wuhan. Taiwan's rapid implementation of disease prevention measures helped detect and isolate the country's first COVID-19 case on January 20, 2020. Laboratories in Taiwan developed 4-hour test kits and isolated 2 strains of the coronavirus before February. Taiwan effectively delayed and contained community transmission by leveraging experience from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, prevalent public awareness, a robust public health network, support from healthcare industries, cross-departmental collaborations, and ad-vanced information technology capacity.

	abstract = {Objectives: Review, compare and critically assess digital technology responses to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world. The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis. Method: This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news articles and other reliable data sources. Results: Most countries’ digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individual’s location databases, code scanning and individual’s online reporting. Public responses of mistrust about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalized solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices. Solutions: The proposed predictive, preventive and personalized solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearable device data, mobile apps data and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (Internet of Things). Conclusion: Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalization of human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared, and lessons have not been learned from previous cases of pandemics. We present a summary of predictive, preventive and personalized digital methods that could be deployed fast to help with the COVID-19 and future pandemics. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Rage is considered one of the prominent emotions that play a crucial role in information security, especially in a user’s behaviour in upholding security policies compliance. However, in current studies, there is a notable gap in the method for assessing the implication of rage as an emotion in influencing the human behaviour in protecting the security of information within an organization. Thus, there is a need to develop a method to assess a user’s rage level at any time during work time to reduce the risk of information security breach or sabotage. We are proposing on designing a chatbot rage assessment method using Kansei Engineering (KE) methodology. The method could be embedded in the organization’s information security policies as one of the security measures and serve as a preventive step to avoid any harm to the organization from the user’s rage outburst. This paper reported the preliminary study in defining and characterizing the functionality of an assessment method using a chatbot interface to measure the user’s rage level, specifically for threats in information security that may be caused by a user’s behaviour caused by the emotion of rage. Findings obtained in this research could potentially provide new essence in emotion assessment research specifically in the information security domain field through KE methodology focusing on rage and contributing to the foundation of emotion embedded artificial intelligence. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Deriving explanations of an Artificial Intelligence-based system's decision making is becoming increasingly essential to address requirements that meet quality standards and operate in a transparent, comprehensive, understandable, and explainable manner. Furthermore, more security issues as well as concerns from human perspectives emerge in describing the explainability properties of AI. A full system view is required to enable humans to properly estimate risks when dealing with such systems. This paper introduces open issues in this research area to present the overall picture of explainability and the required information needed for the explanation to make a decision-oriented AI system transparent to humans. It illustrates the potential contribution of proper provenance data to AI-based systems by describing a provenance graph-based design. This paper proposes a six-Ws framework to demonstrate how a security-aware provenance graph-based design can build the basis for providing end-users with sufficient meta-information on AI-based decision systems. An example scenario is then presented that highlights the required information for better explainability both from human and security-aware aspects. Finally, associated challenges are discussed to provoke further research and commentary. © 2020 IEEE.},

We investigate the existence of CFB and the traditional bullwhip effect (BWE) in a sample of 238 semiconductor companies over 2010-Q1 to 2020-Q4. These companies' average CFB and BWE are 3.95 and 2.77, respectively.

	abstract = {Many industries are facing big challenges to design supply chains in a way to maximize the profit and meet the heightened expectations of the customer. This new era entirely relies on the dynamic advantages of competition and the role played by the collaboration policy. A global economy and increasing demand have put a huge pressure on supply chain partners to build a collaboration policy based on price, order quantity, and advertising. Companies are adopting the idea of ”shaking hands” to obtain more profit instead of taking risks through competition. Cooperative (co-op) advertising is a significant policy of centralized supply chain management (SCM) to boost the revenues generated by the supplier, manufacturer, and retailers. The uncertain costs associated with the supply chain management also create obstacles in economic analysis and feasibility. These uncertainties are associated with the basic costs of all supply chain partners, which are represented using a signed distance formula. This paper develops the concept of co-op advertising among the supplier, manufacturer, and retailers with a variable demand driven by selling price and advertising costs, where all basic costs are considered as fuzzy. The profit is optimized by considering variable cycle time, shipments, pricing and advertising costs for the decision support system of the supply chain management. The optimal results of the co-op advertisement ensured an increase in the revenue of whole supply chain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The first one is a Clinical Decision Support System developed to help specialists with the screening, treatment management, and the collection and analysis of suicide-related data for surveillance purposes. The second component of the platform is HelPath, a mobile-based application, addressed to individuals identified with suicidal behaviour (ideation, planning or attempt). HelPath offers support for the remote and continuous collection of data for the assessment of risk factors and offers suggestions and activities based on Cognitive Behaviour Therapy that can prevent to commit suicide.

For example, autoantibodies combined with other multi-analyte "omic" profiles will form the basis of disease prediction allowing for earlier intervention linked to disease prevention strategies, as well as earlier, effective and personalized interventions for established disease. As medical intervention moves to disease prediction and a model of "intent to PREVENT," diagnostics will include an early symptom/risk-based, as opposed to a disease-based approach. Newer diagnostic platforms that utilize emerging megatrends such as deep learning and artificial intelligence and close the gaps in autoantibody diagnostics will benefit from paradigm shifts thereby facilitating the PH agenda. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.},

	abstract = {Decision analysis and risk analysis have grown up around a set of organizing questions: what might go wrong, how likely is it to do so, how bad might the consequences be, what should be done to maximize expected utility and minimize expected loss or regret, and how large are the remaining risks? In probabilistic causal models capable of representing unpredictable and novel events, probabilities for what will happen, and even what is possible, cannot necessarily be determined in advance. Standard decision and risk analysis questions become inherently unanswerable (“undecidable”) for realistically complex causal systems with “open-world” uncertainties about what exists, what can happen, what other agents know, and how they will act. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques enable agents (e.g., robots, drone swarms, and automatic controllers) to learn, plan, and act effectively despite open-world uncertainties in a host of practical applications, from robotics and autonomous vehicles to industrial engineering, transportation and logistics automation, and industrial process control. This article offers an AI/machine learning perspective on recent ideas for making decision and risk analysis (even) more useful. It reviews undecidability results and recent principles and methods for enabling intelligent agents to learn what works and how to complete useful tasks, adjust plans as needed, and achieve multiple goals safely and reasonably efficiently when possible, despite open-world uncertainties and unpredictable events. In the near future, these principles could contribute to the formulation and effective implementation of more effective plans and policies in business, regulation, and public policy, as well as in engineering, disaster management, and military and civil defense operations. They can extend traditional decision and risk analysis to deal more successfully with open-world novelty and unpredictable events in large-scale real-world planning, policymaking, and risk management. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis},

	abstract = {Personalized nutrition holds tremendous potential to improve human health. Despite exponential growth, the field has yet to be clearly delineated and a consensus definition of the term “personalized nutrition” (PN) has not been developed. Defining and delineating the field will foster standardization and scalability in research, data, training, products, services, and clinical practice; and assist in driving favorable policy. Building on the seminal work of pioneering thought leaders across disciplines, we propose that personalized nutrition be defined as: a field that leverages human individuality to drive nutrition strategies that prevent, manage, and treat disease and optimize health, and be delineated by three synergistic elements: PN science and data, PN professional education and training, and PN guidance and therapeutics. Herein we describe the application of PN in these areas and discuss challenges and solutions that the field faces as it evolves. This and future work will contribute to the continued refinement and growth of the field of PN.Teaching points PN approaches can be most effective when there is consensus regarding its definition and applications. PN can be delineated into three main areas of application: PN science and data, PN education and training, PN guidance and therapeutics. PN science and data foster understanding about the impact of genetic, phenotypic, biochemical and nutritional inputs on an individual’s health. PN education and training equip a variety of healthcare professionals to apply PN strategies in many healthcare settings. PN professionals have greater ability to tailor interventions via PN guidance and therapeutics. Favorable policy allows PN to be more fully integrated into the healthcare system. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

We consider different and parallel perspectives that can support welfare innovation and namely the rise of information and communication technologies in the public sector, the burgeoning initiatives of social innovation in the welfare sector and social changes challenges to the current welfare settlement. This chapter introduces the terms of the discourse starting from the current debate in EU on new policy trends for social protection and its financing. It discusses nature and effects of digital thinking and connects the long-lasting history of social innovation to its recent interpretation as a complex institutional space that changes 'the dominant cognitive frames that frame the social problems'. We describe the theoretical implications and the need for multidisciplinary research in a number of fertile areas. Holistic approaches to welfare innovation, emerging digital technologies and the conditions for DSI to produce structural social change need to be studied in depth. Furthermore, the collection reports many situations in which digital social innovations respond to instances in the welfare sector and contribute to the democratic debate with social experiments. Post-hoc analyzes produce interpretative models that will be useful for informing policy decision-making when political agendas are mature. We intended to recreate the lively debate going on in the field of welfare innovation and represent the many 'orders of the discourse' a reader may encounter. The innovation of the book itself concerns the logic of presentation of new theories, descriptive models and empirical cases, and the resonance of the subtexts that run through all the chapters.  © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.

	abstract = {Concurrent advances in information technology infrastructure and mobile computing power in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have raised hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) might help to address challenges unique to the field of global health and accelerate achievement of the health-related sustainable development goals. A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs. Although some challenges of developing and deploying these interventions might not be unique to these settings, the global health community will need to work quickly to establish guidelines for development, testing, and use, and develop a user-driven research agenda to facilitate equitable and ethical use. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {"The pandemic is a portal."In the words of the novelist scholar Arundhati Roy, the COVID-19 pandemic is not merely an epic calamity. It has opened up a new space, a portal, to rethink everything, for example, in how we live, work, produce scientific knowledge, provide health care, and relate to others, be they humans or nonhuman animals in planetary ecosystems. Meanwhile, as the intensity of the pandemic escalates, digital health tools such as the Internet of Things (IoT), biosensors, and artificial intelligence (AI) are being deployed to address the twin goals of social distancing and health care in a "no touch"emergency state. Permanent integration of digital technologies into every aspect of post-pandemic civic life-health care, disease tracking, education, work, and beyond-is considered by governments and technology actors around the world. Although digital transformation of health care and industry are in the works, we ought to ensure that digital transformation does not degenerate into "digitalism,"which we define here as an unchecked and misguided belief on extreme digital connectivity without considering the attendant adverse repercussions on science, human rights, and everyday practices of democracy. Indeed, the current shrinking of the critically informed public policy space amid a devastating pandemic raises principled questions on the broader and long-term impacts that digital technologies will have on democratic governance of planetary health and society. To this end, a wide range of uncertainties-technical, biological, temporal, spatial, and political-is on the COVID-19 pandemic horizon. This calls for astute and anticipatory innovation policies to steer the health sciences and services toward democratic ends. In this article, we describe new and critically informed approaches to democratize COVID-19 digital health innovation policy, especially when the facts are uncertain, the stakes are high, and decisions are urgent, as they often are in the course of a pandemic. In addition, we introduce a potential remedy to democratize pandemic innovation policy, the concept of "epistemic competence,"so as to check the frames and framings of the pandemic innovation policy juggernaut and the attendant power asymmetries. We suggest that if epistemic competence, and attention to not only scientific knowledge but also its framing are broadly appreciated, they can help reduce the disparity between the enormous technical progress and investments made in digital health versus our currently inadequate understanding of the societal dimensions of emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and extreme digital connectivity on the planet.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

With improved survival of smaller babies, more infants are at risk for ROP, yet there is an increasing shortage of providers to screen and treat ROP. Through a literature review of new and emerging technologies, screening criteria, and analysis of a national survey of pediatric ophthalmologists and retinal specialists, the authors found the shortage of ophthalmology workforce for ROP a serious and growing concern. When used appropriately, emerging technologies have the potential to mitigate gaps in the ROP workforce. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Various emerging technologies challenge existing governance processes to identify, assess, and manage risk. Though the existing risk-based paradigm has been essential for assessment of many chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear technologies, a complementary approach may be warranted for the early-stage assessment and management challenges of high uncertainty technologies ranging from nanotechnology to synthetic biology to artificial intelligence, among many others. This paper argues for a risk governance approach that integrates quantitative experimental information alongside qualitative expert insight to characterize and balance the risks, benefits, costs, and societal implications of emerging technologies. Various articles in scholarly literature have highlighted differing points of how to address technological uncertainty, and this article builds upon such knowledge to explain how an emerging technology risk governance process should be driven by a multi-stakeholder effort, incorporate various disparate sources of information, review various endpoints and outcomes, and comparatively assess emerging technology performance against existing conventional products in a given application area. At least in the early stages of development when quantitative data for risk assessment remain incomplete or limited, such an approach can be valuable for policymakers and decision makers to evaluate the impact that such technologies may have upon human and environmental health. © 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

	abstract = {The economic and legal development of society in recent decades is subject to the two bright trends of cross-border nature: first, these are the parallel processes of globalization and expansion of international integration relations – both global and regional ones – erasing the geographically defined boundaries of state jurisdiction, and secondly, it is the formation of the innovative type of economy – the knowledge economy, which is based on intellectual resources and high technology, including nanotechnology. Despite the progressive effects of these trends on the economy and competitiveness of the state, the list of possible negative consequences, unfortunately, inevitably includes serious environmental risks, which, in turn, significantly complicate the implementation of the concept of sustainable economic development. Meanwhile, the same nanotechnology activity can simultaneously act as a source of environmental risks, as well as an instrument for their neutralization or at least minimization. Thus, one of the ways to reduce cross-border environmental risks can be the use of nanotechnology developments in the production sector, for example, in the electrical industry including an alternative one. In this regard, the paper discusses the latest nanotechnology developments, which are overseen by AO “RUSNANO” (hereinafter – RUSNANO) and the Fund of Infrastructural and Educational Programs (FIOP), aimed at preventing and minimizing the effects of environmental harm, contributing to the economy of natural resources and efficient utilization of industrial waste. The recommendations on streamlining the state system of organizational, financial, legislative and infrastructural measures for nanotechnology development of the alternative energy sector are formulated. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {In complete contract theory, the main approach to limit moral hazard is through modifying incentives for the agents. However, such modifications are not always feasible. One prominent example is Chinese government service provision. Over the years, it has been plagued with inefficiencies as a result of moral hazard. Previous attempts to address these challenges are not effective, as reforms on civil servant incentives face stiff hindrance. In this article, we report an alternative platform - SmartHS - to address these challenges in China without modifying incentives. Through dynamic teamwork, automation of key steps involved in service provision, and improved transparency with the help of artificial intelligence, it places civil servants into an environment that promotes efficiency and reduces the opportunities for moral hazard. Deployment tests in the field of social insurance service provision in three Chinese cities involving close to 3 million social insurance service cases per year demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly reduces moral hazard symptoms. The findings are useful for informing current policy discussions on government reform in China and have the potential to address long-standing problems in government service provision to benefit almost one-fifth of the world's population. © 2020 AI Access Foundation.

	abstract = {Purpose: Accurately forecasting the occurrence of future covid-19-related cases across relaxed (Sweden) and stringent (USA and Canada) policy contexts has a renewed sense of urgency. Moreover, there is a need for a multidimensional county-level approach to monitor the second wave of covid-19 in the USA. Method: We use an artificial intelligence framework based on timeline of policy interventions that triangulated results based on the three approaches—Bayesian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), Kalman filter, and machine learning. Results: Our findings suggest three important insights. First, the effective growth rate of covid-19 infections dropped in response to the approximate dates of key policy interventions. We find that the change points for spreading rates approximately coincide with the timelines of policy interventions across respective countries. Second, forecasted trend until mid-June in the USA was downward trending, stable, and linear. Sweden is likely to be heading in the other direction. That is, Sweden’s forecasted trend until mid-June appears to be non-linear and upward trending. Canada appears to fall somewhere in the middle—the trend for the same period is flat. Third, a Kalman filter based robustness check indicates that by mid-June the USA will likely have close to two million virus cases, while Sweden will likely have over 44,000 covid-19 cases. Conclusion: We show that drop in effective growth rate of covid-19 infections was sharper in the case of stringent policies (USA and Canada) but was more gradual in the case of relaxed policy (Sweden). Our study exhorts policy makers to take these results into account as they consider the implications of relaxing lockdown measures. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.},

	abstract = {Introduction: It is unknown whether patients admitted for all-cause dental conditions (ACDC) are at high risk for hospital readmission, or what are the risk factors for dental hospital readmission. Objective: We examined the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with, 30-day hospital readmission for patients with an all-cause dental admission. We applied artificial intelligence to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict patients at risk of 30-day hospital readmission. Methods: This study used data extracted from the 2013 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). There were a total of 11,341 cases for all-cause index admission for dental patients admitted to the hospitals. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patient characteristics. This study applied five techniques to build risk prediction models and to identify risk factors. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision. Results: There were 11% of patients admitted for ACDC readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge. On average, the total charge per patient was $131,004 for those with 30-day readmission (n=1254) and $69,750 for those without readmission (n=10,087). Factors significantly associated with 30-day hospital readmission included total charges, number of diagnoses, age, number of chronic conditions, length of hospital stays, number of procedures, Medicare insurance and Medicaid insurance, and severity of illness. Model performance from all methods was similar with the artificial neural network showing the highest AUC of 0.739. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that readmission after hospitalization with ACDC is fairly common. If one-third of the 30-day readmission cases can be avoided, there is a potential annual saving of over $25 million among the twenty-one states represented in the NRD. The ML algorithms can predict hospital readmission in dental patients and should be further tested to aid the reduction of hospital readmission and enhancement of patient-centered care. © 2020 Hung et al.},

	abstract = {Several studies address the topic of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) adoption in irrigated agriculture. Many of these studies testify on the growing importance of ICT in influencing the evolution of the sector, especially by bringing down information barriers. While the potentialities of such technologies are widely investigated and confirmed, there is still a gap in understanding and modeling decisions on ICT information implementation. This gap concerns, in particular, accounting for all the aspects of uncertainty which are mainly due to a lack of knowledge on the reliability of ICT and on the errors of ICT-information. Overall, such uncertainties might affect Decision Makers’ (DM’s) behavior and hamper ICT uptake. To support policy makers in the designing of uncertainty-management policies for the achievement of the benefits of a digital irrigated agriculture, we further investigated the topic of uncertainty modelling in ICT uptake decisions. To do so, we reviewed the economic literature on ambiguity, in the context of the wider literature on decision making under uncertainty in order to explore its potential for better modeling ICT uptake decisions. Findings from the discussed literature confirm the capabilities of this approach to yield a deeper understanding of decision processes when the reliability of ICT is unknown and provides better insights on how behavioral barriers to the achievement of potential ICT-benefits can be overcome. Policy implications to accompany the sector in the digitalization process include mainly: (a) defining new approaches for ICT-developers to tailor platforms to answer heterogeneous DMs’ needs; (b) establish uncertainty-management policies complementary to DM tools adoption. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is commonly used to model a sequential decision-making problem where an agent interacts with an uncertain environment while looking for minimizing the expected cost accumulated along the process. If the process horizon is infinite, a discount factor [0, 1] is used to indicate the importance the agent gives to future states. If the agent’s mission is to achieve a goal state, the process becomes a Stochastic Shortest Path MDP (SSP-MDP), the in fact model used for probabilistic planning in AI. Although several efficient solutions have been proposed to solve SSP-MDPs, there are little research carried out when we consider the “risk” in such processes. A Risk Sensitive MDP (RS-MDP) allows modeling the agent’s risk-averse and risk-prone attitudes, by including a risk and a discount factor in the MDP definition. The proof of convergence of known solutions based on dynamic programming adapted for RS-MDPs, such as risk-sensitive value iteration (VI) and risk-sensitive policy iteration (PI), rely on the discount factor. However, when solving an SSP-MDP we look for a proper policy, i.e. a policy that guarantees to reach the goal while minimizing the accumulated expected cost, which is naturally modeled without discount factor. Besides, it has been shown that the discount factor can modify the chosen risk attitude when solving a risk sensitive SSP-MDP. Thus, in this work we aim to formally proof the convergence of the PI algorithm for a Risk Sensitive SSP-MDP based on operators that use a piecewise-linear transformation function, without a discount factor. We also run experiments in the benchmark River domain showing how the intended risk attitude, in an interval of extreme risk-averse and extreme risk-prone, varies with the discount factor, i.e. how an optimal policy for Risk Sensitive SSP-MDP can go from being a risk-prune policy to a risk-averse one, depending on the discount factor. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This project proposes an optimisation of scour protections by combining reliability-based techniques with the novel concepts of dynamic and wide-graded armour layers. The ultimate goal is to develop a decision support system (DSS) for scour protection design and risk and reliability analysis to be used by professionals and researchers dealing with fixed foundations applied to marine renewable energy projects (e.g. wind, wave and tidal). However, a meaningful implementation of such a DSS implies prior analysis of several knowledge gaps related to scour protection in the offshore environment, which are yet to be fully addressed in the literature. This paper provides a brief review of the scientific and technical challenges in the research field of reliability of offshore scour protection. On the basis of identified challenges, the discussion of future research lines is performed with a particular focus on the aim of the Oracle project. The recent findings related to risk and reliability analysis of offshore scour protection are addressed and framed within the existing knowledge gaps in the literature. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

Results suggest: 1) CV is most used in policy planning and surveillance applications, 2) privacy violations is the most likely and most severe risk to arise from modern CV systems designed for the Global South, and 3) researchers from the Global North differ from researchers from the Global South in their uses of CV to solve problems in the Global South. Results of our risk analysis also differ from previous work on CV risk perception in the West, suggesting locality to be a critical component of each risk's importance. © 2020 Canadian Information Processing Society.

	abstract = {The Israeli Ministry of Health has set up the foundations of a National Pharmacovigilance System. The next step is to adopt the best of the international ideas, trends and approaches which are shaping the future of pharmacovigilance. Specifically: 1) The risk management approach requires proactively preventing or minimizing risks, starting in early clinical development and extending all along the lifecycle of a pharmaceutical. 2) Drug safety is a multidisciplinary discipline where all stakeholders should be involved. 3) Clinical trials provide an ideal safety profile limited to the restrictive conditions of the trial. Only real-world data, from the post marketing period, will reveal the real risk/benefit balance for the use of a pharmaceutical in regular clinical care. 4) Artificial intelligence is needed to analyze the large amount of data collected through the post-marketing studies, electronic medical records and the internet. Many AI tools have been developed to support better use of pharmaceuticals. 5) Quality-oriented, thorough inspections and audits are critical for achieving patient safety. 6) Patients should be recognized as active players in their treatment who can, and should, have access to safety information through the major agencies' websites. Israel can benefit from several of its key assets to reach a higher level of pharmacovigilance: 1) Israel's four HMOs are organized in a way that allows them to have quick and efficient dialogue with healthcare professionals and with patients. Moreover, a new project named, Big Data in Health, will pool the epidemiologic databases of the HMOs, providing precious information for understanding risk factors, detecting alerts, and developing personalized medicine. 2) Formal risk management activities have long been part of the culture of hospitals and should be applied increasingly to ensuring drug safety. Israel has the organizational, scientific, technological and cultural resources needed to quickly overcome the challenges and go beyond its current state to build a unique pharmacovigilance system which could serve as an example for other countries. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {We provide excess risk guarantees for statistical learning in a setting where the population risk with respect to which we evaluate a target parameter depends on an unknown parameter that must be estimated from data (a “nuisance parameter”). We analyze a two-stage sample splitting meta-algorithm that takes as input two arbitrary estimation algorithms: one for the target parameter and one for the nuisance parameter. We show that if the population risk satisfies a condition called Neyman orthogonality, the impact of the nuisance estimation error on the excess risk bound achieved by the meta-algorithm is of second order. Our theorem is agnostic to the particular algorithms used for the target and nuisance and only makes an assumption on their individual performance. This enables the use of a plethora of existing results from statistical learning and machine learning literature to give new guarantees for learning with a nuisance component. Moreover, by focusing on excess risk rather than parameter estimation, we can give guarantees under weaker assumptions than in previous works and accommodate the case where the target parameter belongs to a complex nonparametric class. We characterize conditions on the metric entropy such that oracle rates-rates of the same order as if we knew the nuisance parameter-are achieved. We also analyze the rates achieved by specific estimation algorithms such as variance-penalized empirical risk minimization, neural network estimation and sparse high-dimensional linear model estimation. We highlight the applicability of our results in four settings of central importance in the literature: 1) heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, 2) offline policy optimization, 3) domain adaptation, and 4) learning with missing data. © 2020 Inst.

	abstract = {In autonomous exploration a mobile agent must adapt to new measurements to seek high reward, but disturbances cause a probability of collision that must be traded off against expected reward. This paper considers an autonomous agent tasked with maximizing measurements from a Gaussian Process while subject to unbounded disturbances. We seek an adaptive policy in which the maximum allowed probability of failure is constrained as a function of the expected reward. The policy is found using an extension to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which bounds probability of failure. We apply MCTS to a sequence of approximating problems, which allows constraint satisfying actions to be found in an anytime manner. Our innovation lies in defining the approximating problems and replanning strategy such that the probability of failure constraint is guaranteed to be satisfied over the true policy. The approach does not need to plan for all measurements explicitly or constrain planning based only on the measurements that were observed. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to enforce probability of failure constraints in adaptive sampling. Through experiments on real bathymetric data and simulated measurements, we show our algorithm allows an agent to take dangerous actions only when the reward justifies the risk. We then verify through Monte Carlo simulations that failure bounds are satisfied. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.},

Some problems in cyber security such as logical vulnerability, risk assessment, policy validation etc. still require formal approach. In this paper we present the foundations of a new formal framework to address these challenges. Our approach is based on three-level formalisation: ontological, logical and analytical levels. Here we are presenting the first two levels which allow to model the security policies and provide a practical solution to the frame problem by efficient utilization of parameters as side effects. Key concepts are the situations, actions, events and rules. Our framework has potential use for analysis of a wide range of transactional systems within the financial, commercial and business domains and further work will include analytical level where we can perform vulnerability analysis of the model. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2020.},

	abstract = {A quantitative understanding of the hydro-environmental factors that influence the occurrence of agricultural drought events would enable more strategic climate change adaptation and drought management plans. Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994–2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the FDA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and clay content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite the importance of such consent forms, the majority of users tend to ignore them due to their content length and complexity. Thus, users might be consenting policies that are not aligned to regulations in laws such as the GDPR from the EU law. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach which measures a privacy policy’s risk factor applying both supervised deep learning and rule-based information extraction. Benefiting from an annotated dataset of 115 privacy policies, a deep learning component is first able to predict high-level categories for each paragraph. Then, a rule-based module extracts pre-defined attributes and their values, based on high-level classes. Finally, a privacy policy’s risk factor is computed based on these attribute values. © 2019 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

Pandemics need to be reframed from infections we can predict to inevitable infectious and non-communicable surprises with which we need to cope. A hazard-by-hazard approach to planning and response is insufficient when the next pandemic cannot be predicted. Decision-making will benefit from scoping the problem broadly to generate deeper insights into potential threats. The origins of pandemics come from our relationships with the world around us. Health leaders, therefore, need to be aware of primordial determinants of risk arising from these changing relationships. Cross-sectoral co-learning to anticipate surprise will require bridging agents embedded within a health agency to facilitate transdisciplinary intelligence gathering.

A person’s life, for instance, should not be sacrificed for the trivial pleasures of others, no matter how many would benefit. However, according to the decision-theoretic critique of lexical priority theories, accepting lexical priorities inevitably leads us to make unacceptable decisions in risky situations. It seems that to operate in a risky world, we must reject lexical priorities altogether. This paper argues that lexical priority theories can, in fact, offer satisfactory guidance in risky situations. It does so by equipping lexical priority theories with overlooked resources from decision theory. © 2017, © 2017 Canadian Journal of Philosophy.},

We illustrate how existential risks have been discussed at an international governance level, specifically in documents in the UN Digital Library. In this large corpus, discussions of nuclear war account for over two-thirds (69%, 67/97) of mentions of existential risks, while mention of other existential risks, or such risks as a category, appears scant. We take these observations to imply inadequate attention to these significant threats. These deficits, combined with the need for a global response to many risks, suggest that UN member nations should urgently advocate for appropriate action at the UN to address threats, such as artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, geoengineering, and supervolcanic eruption, in analogous fashion to existing attempts to mitigate the threats from nuclear war or near-Earth objects. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis},

	abstract = {The definition of sepsis continues to be as dynamic as the management strategies used to treat this. Sepsis-3 has replaced the earlier systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-based diagnoses with the rapid Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score assisting in predicting overall prognosis with regards to mortality. Surgeons have an important role in ensuring adequate source control while recognizing the threat of carbapenem-resistance in gram-negative organisms. Rapid diagnostic tests are being used increasingly for the early identification of multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs), with a key emphasis on the multidisciplinary alert of results. Novel, higher generation antibiotic agents have been developed for resistance in ESKCAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) organisms while surgeons have an important role in the prevention of spread. The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy (STOP-IT) trial has challenged the previous paradigm of length of antibiotic treatment whereas biomarkers such as procalcitonin are playing a prominent role in individualizing therapy. Several novel therapies for refractory septic shock, while still investigational, are gaining prominence rapidly (such as vitamin C) whereas others await further clinical trials. Management strategies presented as care bundles continue to be updated by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, yet still remain controversial in its global adoption. We have broadened our temporal and epidemiologic perspective of sepsis by understanding it both as an acute, time-sensitive, life-threatening illness to a chronic condition that increases the risk of mortality up to five years post-discharge. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and bedside scoring systems can assist the clinician in predicting post-operative sepsis. The public health role of the surgeon is key. This includes collaboration and multi-disciplinary antibiotic stewardship at a hospital level. It also requires controlling pharmaceutical sales and the unregulated dispensing of antibiotic agents globally through policy initiatives to control emerging resistance through prevention. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.},

Operating reserves are used by system operators to deal with unexpected variations of demand and generation, and maintain a secure operation of the system. This becomes increasingly challenging due to the increasing share of renewable generation based on variable resources. This paper revisits the current sizing method applied in Belgium, which is based on a static approach that determines the required capacity once a year. The presented dynamic sizing method determines the required capacity on a daily basis, using the estimated probability of facing a system imbalance during the next day. This risk is estimated based on historical observations of system conditions by means of machine learning algorithms. A proof of concept is presented for the Belgian system, and demonstrates that the proposed methodology improves reliability management while decreasing the average capacity to be contracted. The method is compliant with European market design, and the corresponding regulatory framework, and is of particular interest for systems with a high share of renewable generation. For these reasons a gradual implementation in Belgium towards 2020 has been decided based on the results of this study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

After elevated levels of lead were detected in residents' drinking water, followed by an increase in blood lead levels in area children, the state and federal governments directed over $125 million to replace water service lines, the pipes connecting each home to the water system. In the absence of accurate records, and with the high cost of determining buried pipe materials, we put forth a number of predictive and procedural tools to aid in the search and removal of lead infrastructure. Alongside these statistical and machine learning approaches, we describe our interactions with government officials in recommending homes for both inspection and replacement, with a focus on the statistical model that adapts to incoming information. Finally, in light of discussions about increased spending on infrastructure development by the federal government, we explore how our approach generalizes beyond Flint to other municipalities nationwide. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Health-care policies advocate that individuals at high risk of developing T2DM undertake lifestyle modification, irrespective of whether the prediabetes phenotype is defined by hyperglycaemia in the postprandial state (impaired glucose tolerance) and/or fasting state (impaired fasting glucose) or by intermediate HbA1c levels. However, current evidence indicates that diabetes prevention programmes based on lifestyle change have not been successful in preventing T2DM in individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose. We propose that further research is needed to identify effective lifestyle interventions for individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose. Furthermore, we call for the identification of innovative approaches that better identify people with impaired glucose tolerance, who benefit from the currently available lifestyle-based diabetes prevention programmes. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.},

From a systems-thinking perspective, and in today’s world of seamless boundaries and global interconnectivity, AI offers enormous potential for public health practitioners and policy makers to revolutionize healthcare and population health through focussed, context-specific interventions that promote cost-savings on therapeutic care, expand access to health information and services, and enhance individual responsibility for their health and well-being.

	abstract = {Knowing when a driver will quit cruising and either leave the area or park at an expensive off-street facility is critical for modeling parking search. We employ a serious game - PARKGAME for estimating the dynamics of drivers' decision making. 49 Participants of a game experiment were involved in three scenarios where they had to arrive on time to a fictional appointment or face monetary penalties, and to choose between uncertain but cheap on-street parking or a certain but costly parking lot. Scenarios diverged on the time to appointment and distance between the meeting place and parking lot locations. Players played a series of 8 or 16 computer games on a Manhattan grid road network with high on-street parking occupancy and nearby parking lot of unlimited capacity. Players' choices to quit or to continue search, as dependent on the search time, were analyzed with an accelerated-failure time (AFT) model. Results show that drivers are mostly risk-averse and quit on-street parking search very soon after potential loses begin to accumulate. The implications of game-based methods for simulation model development and sustainable parking policy are further discussed. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

	abstract = {Physicians still lack consensus on the meaning of race. When the Journal took up the topic in 2003 with a debate about the role of race in medicine, one side argued that racial and ethnic categories reflected underlying population genetics and could be clinically useful.1 Others held that any small benefit was outweighed by potential harms that arose from the long, rotten history of racism in medicine.2 Weighing the two sides, the accompanying Perspective article concluded that though the concept of race was "fraught with sensitivities and fueled by past abuses and the potential for future abuses," race-based medicine still had potential: "it seems unwise to abandon the practice of recording race when we have barely begun to understand the architecture of the human genome."3 The next year, a randomized trial showed that a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate reduced mortality due to heart failure among patients who identified themselves as black. The Food and Drug Administration granted a race-specific indication for that product, BiDil, in 2005.4 Even though BiDil's ultimate commercial failure cast doubt on race-based medicine, it did not lay the approach to rest. Prominent geneticists have repeatedly called on physicians to take race seriously,5,6 while distinguished social scientists vehemently contest these calls.7,8 Our understanding of race and human genetics has advanced considerably since 2003, yet these insights have not led to clear guidelines on the use of race in medicine. The result is ongoing conflict between the latest insights from population genetics and the clinical implementation of race. For example, despite mounting evidence that race is not a reliable proxy for genetic difference, the belief that it is has become embedded, sometimes insidiously, within medical practice. One subtle insertion of race into medicine involves diagnostic algorithms and practice guidelines that adjust or "correct" their outputs on the basis of a patient's race or ethnicity. Physicians use these algorithms to individualize risk assessment and guide clinical decisions. By embedding race into the basic data and decisions of health care, these algorithms propagate race-based medicine. Many of these race-adjusted algorithms guide decisions in ways that may direct more attention or resources to white patients than to members of racial and ethnic minorities. To illustrate the potential dangers of such practices, we have compiled a partial list of raceadjusted algorithms (Table 1). We explore several of them in detail here. Given their potential to perpetuate or even amplify race-based health inequities, they merit thorough scrutiny. © 2020 Massachussetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: Many countries have implemented quarantine rules during the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Understanding how hospitals can continue providing services in an effective manner under these circumstances is thus important. In this study, we investigate how information technology (IT) helped hospitals in mainland China better respond to the outbreak of the pandemic. Materials and Methods: We conducted a content analysis of pages published on the websites of the top 50 hospitals in mainland China between January 22 and February 21, 2020. In total, we analyzed 368 pages that the hospitals published during the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose was to identify common themes related to the utilization of IT by these hospitals in response to the pandemic's outbreak. Results: We identified 5 focal themes across the webpages published by the hospitals during our study period, including (1) popular medical science education, (2) digitalized hospital processes, (3) knowledge management for medical professionals, (4) telemedicine, and (5) new IT initiatives for healthcare services. Our analysis revealed that Chinese hospitals spent greater effort in promoting popular medical science education in the initial stages of our study period and more on telemedicine in the latter stages. Discussion: We propose a configurational approach for hospitals to design response strategies to pandemic outbreaks based on their available resources. Conclusions: Our study provides rich insights for hospitals to better utilize their IT resources and some recommendations for policymaker to better support hospitals in the future.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This is mainly due to the relatively slow progress in the theoretical formulation and the technological foundation of the cyber security concepts such as logical vulnerability, threats, and risks. In this article, we are proposing a framework for logical analysis, threat intelligence, and validation of security policies in cyber systems. It is based on multi-level model, consisting of ontology of situations and actions under security threats, security policies governing the security-related activities, and graph of the transactions. The framework is validated using a set of scenarios describing the most common security threats in digital banking, and a prototype of an event-driven engine for navigation through the intelligence graphs has been implemented. Although the framework was developed specifically for application in digital banking, the authors believe that it has much wider applicability to security policy analysis, threat intelligence, and security by design of cyber systems for financial, commercial, and business operations. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly entering medical practice, whether for risk prediction, diagnosis, or treatment recommendation. But a persistent question keeps arising: What happens when things go wrong? When patients are injured, and AI was involved, who will be liable and how? Liability is likely to influence the behavior of physicians who decide whether to follow AI advice, hospitals that implement AI tools for physician use, and developers who create those tools in the first place. If physicians are shielded from liability (typically medical malpractice liability) when they use AI tools, even if patient injury results, they are more likely to rely on these tools, even if the AI recommendations are counterintuitive. On the other hand, if physicians face liability from deviating from standard practice, whether an AI recommends something different or not, the adoption of AI is likely to be slower, and counterintuitive rejections-even correct ones-are likely to be rejected. In this issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, Tobia et al. (1) offer an important empiric look at this question, which has significant implications as to whether and when AI will come into clinical use. © 2021 Society of Nuclear Medicine Inc..

It is generally accepted that the construction of access control policies is not a straightforward task. Further, any mistakes in the process have the potential to give rise both to security risks, due to the provision of inappropriate access, and to frustration on behalf of legitimate end-users when they are prevented from performing essential tasks. In this paper we describe a tool for constructing role-based access control (RBAC) policies, which are automatically checked for conformance with constraints described using predicate logic. These constraints may represent general healthiness conditions that should hold of all policies conforming to a general model, or capture requirements pertaining to a particular deployment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

This paper proposes a conceptual framework to build theoretical foundation and demonstrate technologies for creating a decision support system for optimizing stakeholders' resource allocation in natural hazards. The proposed framework will: (1) minimize the total costs associated with implementing such investment strategies and (2) maximize the uniformity of welfare distribution among all associated parties. This would provide broad members of the emergency management community as well as policy makers with easy-to-use preparedness and decision support tool, which would help in creating better societal financial resilience towards natural hazards.

	abstract = {Telehealth possesses a significant potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery processes by challenging some of the long-held assumptions about healthcare delivery and by creating innovative alternative models. Those assumptions relate to the location-linked nature of healthcare and its episodic nature. Telehealth can challenge the assumption that healthcare is inextricably linked to the provider's location. Numerous models involving such approaches as interactive videoconferencing and store-and-forward technologies already exist. Telehealth also challenges the episodic nature of care. One example is provided by the models evolving from the convergence of three technologies: remote monitoring, electronic health records, and clinical decision support systems. Telehealth-based models of care can also lead to a reduced demand for services and greater efficiencies in the care process. These telehealth-enabled care delivery models have the potential to reduce the costs of care, improve quality, and mitigate provider shortages. However, the achievement of these goals is not straightforward. The current healthcare financing system is not designed to support such new models, and the existing healthcare culture is deeply ingrained within workflow processes and provider attitudes. A great deal of work remains to be done before the benefits of telehealth-based care delivery models are fully realized. Change is inherently risky but we must have the courage to assume the risk in order to create telehealth-driven innovations that lead to better and more cost-effective medical care for all. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Building sophisticated computer players for games has been of interest since the advent of artificial intelligence research. Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques have led to recent advances in the performance of computer players in a variety of games. Without any refinements, the commonly-used upper confidence bounds applied to trees (UCT) selection policy for MCTS performs poorly on games with high branching factors, because an inordinate amount of time is spent performing simulations from each sibling of a node before that node can be further investigated. Move-ordering heuristics are usually proposed to address this issue, but when the branching factor is large, it can be costly to order candidate actions. We propose a technique combining sampling from the action space with a naive evaluation function for identifying nodes to add to the tree when using MCTS in cases where the branching factor is large. The approach is evaluated on a restricted version of the board game Risk with promising results.},

The abundance of systemic risk measures and risk models has added to the complex task of understanding, discussing, and acting on the implications of that risk. Tools that assist decision makers to interpret risk measures, and recognize their underlying assumptions may lead to deeper understanding and more effective discussion. This paper describes some initial considerations for building an integrated modeling and analysis environment to aid in assessing complex financial data. The modeling environment is engineered to support execution of quantitative models including agent based and network models against equivalent scenarios of economic conditions. The environment provides tools to compare and visualize model outputs, and to allow decision makers to maintain traceability from model outputs back to their underlying assumptions. This capability may facilitate the operation of a modeling forum where disparate teams of analysts can collaborate to provide insights into the nation's exposure to systemic financial risk. © 2012 IEEE.},

Actions executed by the robot impact on humans, and as such have to be carefully selected, making it impossible to rely on random exploration. Additionally, no clear reward function exists for social interactions. This implies that traditional approaches used for Reinforcement Learning cannot be directly applied for learning how to interact with the social world. As such we argue that robots will profit from human expertise and guidance to learn social interactions. However, as the quantity of input a human can provide is limited, new methods have to be designed to use human input more efficiently. In this paper we describe a setup in which we combine a framework called Supervised Progressively Autonomous Robot Competencies (SPARC), which allows safer online learning with Reinforcement Learning, with the use of partial states radier than full states to accelerate generalisation and obtain a usable action policy more quickly.

	abstract = {We explore the strategic interactions among oligopolists providing future and spot output simultaneously in condition of uncertainty and risk-averse downstream user. Upstream oligopolistic motivation for providing long term contracts is weakened since downstream users' risk-aversion leads to long term contract price lower than expected spot price while demand fluctuation is stochastic. Although this to some extant alleviates competition intensity among oligopolists, they will still provide long term contracts strategically. Furthermore, a more realistic assumption is made about demand fluctuation, i.e., demand is intertemporally correlated. We find that oligopolists are more likely to turn off future market and only provide output in spot market in periods with high growing demand. This study does not only offer a new perspective to understand oligopolistic behaviors in the iron ore industry and other industries such as electricity and natural gas which have similar characteristics, but also can help understand business strategies such as competition in multi-markets and intertemporally bundling. © 2011 IEEE.},

In this paper, we focus on the risks associated with increased investment of surplus funds for the operations of financial institutions. The authors have proposed an agent model of interlocking specific bankruptcy that arises through a change in the financial situation due to market price fluctuations involving assets held by financial institutions. To extend the model to deal with macro market shock, we describe decision-making regarding funds that are surplus to the operation of financial institutions. Additionally, we analyze the impact on the financial system of price declines involving marketable assets.},

Technical Analysis methods demand only data that are easily available, i.e. the series of prices and trade volumes, and are then very useful to predict current price trends. Analysts have however to deal with the fact that the indications of these methods are uncertain, having different interpretations. In this work, we assume the hypothesis that an investment context can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and partial observations of price trends can be provided by Technical Analysis methods. A metamodel is proposed to specify POMDP problems, embedding formal interpretations of Technical Analysis methods. Planning algorithms can then try to create investment policies to maximize profits. Due to the complexity for solving POMDPs, algorithms that generate only approximate solutions have to be applied. Nevertheless, the results obtained by an implemented prototype are promising. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Time-consistency is a minimal requirement on an optimization problem for the decisions made based on its solution to be rational. We show that the return that we can gain by taking “optimal” actions selected by solving a time-inconsistent optimization problem can be surely dominated by that we could gain by taking “suboptimal” actions. We establish sufficient conditions on the objective function and on the constraints for an optimization problem to be time-consistent. We also show when the sufficient conditions are necessary. Our results are relevant in stochastic settings particularly when the objective function is a risk measure other than expectation or when there is a constraint on a risk measure.

We present a system dynamics (SD) DSS, loosely coupled with a geographic information system (GIS) for water portfolio scenario analysis for Mesa, Arizona. The application demonstrates a multi-scale, modular, spatial framework for downscaling a regional dynamic water budget to the specific water portfolio of the City of Mesa. Climate change, population growth, surface water allocations, and groundwater supplies are calculated from WaterSim, a regional DSS developed at the Decision Center for a Desert City at Arizona State University; Mesa's specific water portfolios are generated via a portfolio module that extends the WaterSim framework to include city-scale demands, conservation estimates, "water-banking" credits, and multi-institutional constraints. The portfolio module connects a regional supply module to local and regional demand modules so that meaningful, scenario-based exploration of the city's water assets can be examined for adequacy and risk of shortages. In particular, conditions of drought, climate change, population growth, urbanization, and land-use change are simulated to reveal robust portfolio allocations that can better guarantee adequate water supplies with low cost and low risk of shortage under a broad range of conditions. Our scenario framework classifies scenario models into exogenous factors, policy options, and outcome metrics to systematically assess the key sensitivities of Mesa's water supply portfolio. © 2008 ASCE.},

	abstract = {As European forest policy increasingly focuses on multiple ecosystem services and participatory decision making, forest managers and policy planners have a need for integrated, user-friendly, broad spectrum decision support systems (DSS) that address risks and uncertainties, such as climate change, in a robust way and that provide credible advice in a transparent manner, enabling effective stakeholder involvement. The Sim4Tree DSS has been accordingly developed as a user-oriented, modular and multipurpose toolbox. Sim4Tree supports strategic and tactical forestry planning by providing simulations of forest development, ecosystem services potential and economic performance through time, from a regional to a stand scale, under various management and climate regimes. Sim4Tree allows comparing the performance of different scenarios with regard to diverse criteria so as to optimize management choices. This paper explains the concept, characteristics, functionalities, components and use of the current Sim4Tree DSS v2.5, which was parameterized for the region of Flanders, Belgium, but can be flexibly adapted to allow a broader use. When considering the current challenges for forestry DSS, an effort has been made towards the participatory component and towards integration, while the lack of robustness remains Sim4Tree's weakest point. However, its structural flexibility allows many possibilities for future improvement and extension. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To optimize the proportion of asset to be allocated to each recommendations of the predictors, we design an asset allocator called meta policy in the Q-learning framework. We utilize both the information of each predictor's recommendations and the ratio of the stock fund over the asset to efficiently describe the state space. The experimental results on Korean stock market show that the trading system with the proposed asset allocator outperforms other systems with fixed asset allocation methods. This means that reinforcement learning can bring synergy effects to the decision making problem through exploiting supervised-learned predictors. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer diagnosis requires specific expertise from the Medical Doctors. Furthermore, prognosis, monitoring and early detection of malignant findings can be successfully realized through synergies between physicians, researchers and general population in concert with the health policy program of each country. Information technology and computational intelligence play a crucial role in the production of digital repositories and cancer registries as well as in the development of systems to support diagnosis. In this paper we present the concept and the architecture of an approved grant under the National Strategic Reference Framework 2007-2013 (NSRF), called e-Prolipsis. Through this project, we will design and implement a web based risk estimation platform and a Central Breast Cancer Registry (CBCR) that will co-operate to provide medical doctors and patients with services such as multiplicity in diagnostic opinions, synergy, computational risk estimation, access to statistical/ epidemiological data for trend estimation. Such a system, will serve as a reference tool and will help the clinician, the radiologist, the rural doctor or trainee doctor in the final assessment on the existence or likelihood of breast cancer. The system will assist in the successful diagnosis of breast cancer, giving each patient access to a large pool of doctors and at the same time, the data stored in the CBCR will be used for statistical analysis, providing useful results for improving both the cancer detection application and for making a national policy for combating breast cancer. This system will be accessible through a Web Portal, with different access levels for patients, doctors and general public and different web services available to each user group, eliminating the geographical distances that would be imposed otherwise. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods for selecting a production plan for an open pit mine is based on the assumption that ore grades throughout mine life as well as market variables are known with certainty. Another important issue that is also being ignored in the conventional procedure is the value of management flexibility to revise operating policy with time according to the arrival of new information. Based on this oversimplification of reality, an optimum mine plan that is thought to be maximizing net present value (NPV) of the project is selected. Given the multiple sources of risk affecting the estimated NPV, there is a high probability that the actual value will be different from that estimated. This could mislead decision making process regarding selecting an optimum mine plan. This paper proposes a multi-criteria ranking system for selection between alternative mine designs under both geological and market uncertainties. The system is based on integrating multiple market and geological uncertainties as well as the operating flexibility to revise the ultimate pit limits using a Monte Carlo-based real options valuation (ROV) model. To compare the methods, the article applies the proposed system, along with the conventional NPV-based method, to rank possible mine designs for a copper and a gold mine. It has been found that, considering multiple risk analysis measures while integrating uncertainty and operating flexibility results in selecting a mine design that is different from that selected by the conventional method.},

	abstract = {Congenital malformations (CM) are abnormalities of structures arising during the prenatal development and hampering body functions later in life. Causes of CM can be genetic, environmental or any kind of drug exposure during the pregnancy. CM is one of the most important causes of infant mortality in the developing countries. In Pakistan 6-9% of the perinatal deaths are attributed to CM, but a comprehensive nation-wide data on the prevalence, nature and dynamics of CM are largely missing. Hence, the aim of present study is to forecast the prevalence of CM in the multiethnic and multilinguistic population of Rawalpindi/Islamabad through an inference engine. Inference engine helps in formulating new conclusions about the data that is provided to the inference engine and stored in the knowledge base of the inference engine. This pilot engine presents a comprehensive overview of neonatal and maternal parameters and highlights the potential risk factors associated with CM by formulating new conclusions. Additionally, this inference engine would be helpful to establish the dynamics of CM in our society. It is anticipated that such project conducted on a country-wide sample could be highly beneficial in guiding our national health policy, resource allocation and management of CM. © 2015 IEEE.},

Attention was focused on the lack of clarity concerning the need for end point adjudication in both CV and non-CV trials: there is currently an absence of widely accepted academic or industry standards and a definitive regulatory policy on how best to structure and use clinical end point committees (CECs). This meeting therefore provided a forum for leaders in the fields of CV clinical trials and CV safety to develop a foundation of initial best practice recommendations for use in future CEC charters. Attendees included representatives from pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, end point adjudication specialist groups, clinical research organizations, and active, academically based adjudicators. The manuscript presents recommendations from the think tank regarding when CV end point adjudication should be considered in trials conducted by cardiologists and by noncardiologists as well as detailing key issues in the composition of a CEC and its charter. In addition, it presents several recommended best practices for the establishment and operation of CECs. The science underlying CV event adjudication is evolving, and suggestions for additional areas of research will be needed to continue to advance this science.

At present a new type of exchange is emerging in the world - the environment exchange, i.e. transactions with licences for carbon emissions, bonds for natural calamities, bonds for drought, products as negotiable climatic derivates, and specific insurance policies, using spot buying-and- selling contracts, options, futures and hedging. The new financial market is the consequence of the process of world heating, which apart from important climatic changes and anxiety regarding quality of life has entailed a new division of labour. For this market new types of indicators are needed in order to measure the effects, to evaluate the trends, to make and evaluate predictions. The design of these financial indicators implies econometric calculations under risk and uncertainty and for this reason in the present article modelling fuzzy methods are proposed. © 2008 IEEE.},

To make such a DSS even more valuable, we propose to also include the citizens' response to policies. A multi agent simulation (MAS) can play a methodological key role in a DSS dealing with complex issues and the overall long-term development of the citizens' satisfaction. It helps by representing responses of citizen agents to different political-economical scenarios. Since people differ with respect to their psychological reactivity these differences should be modelled including aspects like risk perception and social stratification, e.g. lifestyles. To demonstrate the usefulness of such a concept, we apply it to the perception and the experience of water related risks in the context of climate change. The MAS model and results from scenario runs are shown.},

At each step, an agent chooses a subset of the K ≥ 1 possible actions. For each action chosen, she then respectively pays and receives the sum of a random number of costs and rewards. Her objective is to maximize her cumulated profit. We adapt and study three well-known strategies in this purpose, that were proved to be most efficient in other settings: kl-UCB, Bayes-UCB and Thompson Sampling. For each of them, we prove a finite time regret bound which, together with a lower bound we obtain as well, establishes asymptotic optimality in some cases. Our goal is also to compare these three strategies from a theoretical and empirical perspective both at the same time. We give simple, self-contained proofs that emphasize their similarities, as well as their differences. While both Bayesian strategies are automatically adapted to the geometry of information, the numerical experiments carried out show a slight advantage for Thompson Sampling in practice. © 2018 M.

Developing wind energy on a large scale however raises other problems such as choosing an adequate site to settle a wind farm where many other issues such technical feasibility and performance levels, visual pollution, economic and social concerns, etc. must be addressed. Such decisions usually involve many parameters and necessitate the collaboration of many stakeholders. In this context, this chapter proposes an approach based on the concept of bipolar analysis through Benefit Opportunity Cost and Risk (BOCR) analysis, which permits one to address correctly a Group Decision-Making Problem (GDMP) to build a decision support system in order to assist the wind farm installation process. © 2015 by IGI Global.

A common approach to identifying lead hazards is to test all children for elevated blood lead levels and then investigate and remediate the homes of children with elevated tests. This can prevent exposure to lead of future residents, but only after a child has been poisoned. This paper describes joint work with the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) in which we build a model that predicts the risk of a child to being poisoned so that an intervention can take place before that happens. Using two decades of blood lead level tests, home lead inspections, property value assessments, and census data, our model allows inspectors to prioritize houses on an intractably long list of potential hazards and identify children who are at the highest risk. This work has been described by CDPH as pioneering in the use of machine learning and predictive analytics in public health and has the potential to have a significant impact on both health and economic outcomes for communities across the US. © 2015 ACM.},

We show that the return that we can gain by taking "optimal" actions selected by solving a time-inconsistent optimization problem can be surely dominated by that we could gain by taking "suboptimal" actions. We establish sufficient conditions on the objective function and on the constraints for an optimization problem to be time-consistent. We also show when the sufficient conditions are necessary. Our results are relevant in stochastic settings particularly when the objective function is a risk measure other than expectation or when there is a constraint on a risk measure.

	abstract = {Mitigating risk in decision-making has been a longstanding problem. Due to the mathematical challenge of its nonlinear nature, especially in adaptive decisionmaking problems, finding optimal policies is typically intractable. With a focus on efficient algorithms, we ask how well we can approximate the optimal policies for the difficult case of general utility models of risk. Little is known about efficient algorithms beyond the very special cases of linear (risk-neutral) and exponential utilities since general utilities are not separable and preclude the use of traditional dynamic programming techniques. In this paper, we consider general utility functions and investigate efficient computation of approximately optimal routing policies, where the goal is to maximize the expected utility of arriving at a destination around a given deadline. We present an adaptive discretization variant of successive approximation which gives an e-optimal policy in polynomial time. The main insight is to perform discretization at the utility level space, which results in a nonuniform discretization of the domain, and applies for any monotone utility function. © Copyright 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

	abstract = {The efficient use of limited computational resources is an essential ingredient of intelligence. Selecting computations optimally according to rational metareasoning would achieve this, but this is computationally intractable. Inspired by psychology and neuroscience, we propose the first concrete and domain-general learning algorithm for approximating the optimal selection of computations: Bayesian metalevel policy search (BMPS). We derive this general, sample-efficient search algorithm for a computation-selecting metalevel policy based on the insight that the value of information lies between the myopic value of information and the value of perfect information. We evaluate BMPS on three increasingly difficult metareasoning problems: when to terminate computation, how to allocate computation between competing options, and planning. Across all three domains, BMPS achieved near-optimal performance and compared favorably to previously proposed metar-easoning heuristics. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of BMPS in an emergency management scenario, even accounting for the overhead of metareasoning. © 34th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence 2018.

Furthermore, evidence from neuro-biology shows that the natural mental processes of human beings will result in decision making patterns that differ from what is predicted and implicit in cumulative prospect theory and prospect theory. Decision making and risk assessment are multi-criteria processes that typically require some processing of information, and thus cannot be defined accurately by rigid quantitative models.

	abstract = {Emissions trading is, essentially, a policy instrument that is designed to simulate a market for an otherwise public good. Conceptually, its justification hinges on a number of key assumptions, namely the negligibility of local impacts, the ability to separate and commodify the good in question, and characteristics of a well-functioning market. The authors examine the performance of RECLAIM, a NOx emissions trading program in Southern California, USA, and illustrate how to test these assumptions. There is some evidence that the trading of NOx generates new externalities, such as the possibility that other air pollutants, e.g. volatile organics, are essentially traded along with it. Moreover, the RECLAIM program has recently begun to experience difficulties due to the fact that the market is relatively thin. This analysis provides ways to assess more deeply and reform these trading regimes, including opening up RECLAIM to public review. The case study speaks to a wider arena, as emissions trading is presently being considered in other parts of the world to address issues ranging from acid rain to non-point source pollution to greenhouse gases. The analytic approach, illustrated herein, is a general one that has a wider applicability than the particular case of NOx trading. It is hoped that this kind of critical inquiry can lead to a more careful deliberation of the merits and challenges of emissions trading. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Disruptions in the production of commodities and services resulting from disasters influence the vital functions of infrastructure and economic sectors within a region. The interdependencies inherent among these sectors trigger the faster propagation of disaster consequences that are often associated with a wider range of inoperability and amplified losses. This article evaluates the impact of inventory-enhanced policies for disrupted interdependent sectors to improve the disaster preparedness capability of dynamic inoperability input-output models (DIIM). In this article, we develop the dynamic cross-prioritization plot (DCPP)-a prioritization methodology capable of identifying and dynamically updating the critical sectors based on preference assignments to different objectives. The DCPP integrates the risk assessment metrics (e.g., economic loss and inoperability), which are independently analyzed in the DIIM. We develop a computer-based DCPP tool to determine the priority for inventory enhancement with user preference and resource availability as new dimensions. A baseline inventory case for the state of Virginia revealed a high concentration of (i) manufacturing sectors under the inoperability objective and (ii) service sectors under the economic loss objective. Simulation of enhanced inventory policies for selected critical manufacturing sectors has reduced the recovery period by approximately four days and the expected total economic loss by $33 million. Although the article focuses on enhancing inventory levels in manufacturing sectors, complementary analysis is recommended to manage the resilience of the service sectors. The flexibility of the proposed DCPP as a decision support tool can also be extended to accommodate analysis in other regions and disaster scenarios. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.},

To address this, ser vices typically provide various privacy "knobs" that the user may adjust to limit access by content type or user identity. However, the main purpose of social networks, community building, is largely at odds with this, hence it is unsurprising that privacy breaches in social networks are increasingly discovered. We argue that this tension between social networking goals and privacy suggests that research efforts should be focused more on efficient methods for detecting privacy breaches in social networks and on building user awareness of privacy risks and the trade-off between privacy and utility. We support our argument with a simple method for discovering LinkedIn contacts ostensibly hidden by privacy settings. This method appears discoverable with a straightforward analysis of the LinkedIn system and its features (indeed, LinkedIn is likely aware of this method), however Linkedin's privacy instructions suggest to users that implementing a privacy setting will prevent such discovery.

This paper explores the production of medical isotopes in Canada as an illustration of complex issues requiring decision support. It proposes a four-feature strategy for policy makers. Tightly but inversely connected, risks generated by either the production or non-production of medical isotopes are multidimensional and located on both the demand (healthy citizens and their well-being) and supply (safety of production) sides. The decision making also involves multidisciplinary considerations. Another feature of the process is the geographic scale. Production goes beyond domestic needs as global society depends on medical isotopes and must rely on very few producers. Finally, time scale adds to the complexity of the strategy, as developing technology alternatives on both the supply and demand sides requires a long-term perspective. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Investment decisions in renewable energy sources such as small hydro, wind power, biomass and solar are frequently made in the context of enormous uncertainty surrounding both intermittent generation and the highly volatile electricity spot prices that are used for clearing of trades. This paper presents a new portfolio-based approach for selecting long-term investments in small-scale renewable energy projects and matching contracts for the sale of the resulting electricity. Using this approach, we have formulated a stochastic optimisation model that maximises a holding company's risk-averse measure of value. Using an illustrative example representative of investment decisions within the Brazilian electricity system, we investigate the sensitivity of the optimised portfolio composition and commercialisation strategy to contract prices in the free contracting environment and to the decision maker's attitude towards risk. The numerical results demonstrate it is possible to reduce significantly financial risks, such as the price-quantity risk, not only by exploiting the complementarity of the considered renewable sources generation profiles, but also by selecting the optimal mix of commercialisation contracts from different markets. We find that the multi-market strategy generally results in appreciably higher optimal value than single-market strategies and can be applied to a wide range of renewable generators and contracts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) can facilitate the delivery of a wide range of policy objectives. There are six main objectives/benefits identified in the international literature: Safety (reduction of (potential) crashes), mobility (reduction of delays and travel times), efficiency (optimise the use of existing infrastructure), productivity (cost saving), energy/environment and customer satisfaction [Mitretek Systems, 2001. Intelligent Transport System Benefits: 2001 update, Under Contract to the Federal Highway Administration, US Department of Transportation, Washington, DC, US]. In the South African context, there is an interest for measures that can reduce (potential) crashes. In South Africa the number of year on year traffic related fatalities is still increasing. In 2005 the number of fatalities was 15 393 (from 14 135 in 2004) while the estimated costs for the same period increased from R8.89-billion to R9.99-billion [RTMC, 2007. Interim Road Traffic and Fatal Crash Report 2006, Road Traffic Management Corporation, Pretoria, SA]. Given the extent of the road safety problem and the potential benefits of ITS, the need for further research is apparent. A study with regards to the potential of different types of models (macroscopic, mesoscopic and miscroscopic simulation models) led to the use of Paramics. Two corridors and three types of ITS measures were investigated and safety benefits were estimated. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Currently, specific management guidelines must be implemented for guaranteeing the safe reuse of organic waste in agriculture. With that aim, this work was focused on the development of a decision support tool for a safe and sustainable management of cattle manure as fertiliser in pastureland, to control and limit metal accumulation in soil and to reduce metal biotransfer from soil to other compartments. The system was developed on the basis of an environmental risk assessment multi-compartmental model. In contrast to other management tools, a long-term dynamic modelling approach was selected considering the persistence of metals in the environment. A detailed description of the underlying flow equations which accounts for distribution, human exposure and risk characterisation of metals in the assessed scenario was presented, as well as model parameterization. The tool was implemented in Visual C++ and is structured on a data base, where all required data is stored, the risk assessment model and a GIS module for the visualization of the scenario characteristics and the results obtained (risk indexes). The decision support system allows choosing among three estimation options, depending on the needs of the user, which provide information to both farmers and policy makers. The first option is useful for evaluating the adequacy of the current management practices of the different farms, and the remaining ones provides information on the measures that can be taken to carry out a fertilising plan without exceeding risk to human health. Among other results, maximum values of application rates of manure, maximum permissible metal content of manure and maximum application times in a particular scenario can be estimated by this system. To illustrate tool application, a real case study with data corresponding to different farms of a milk production cooperative was presented. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Carfì. Specifically, we will focus on two economic operators: a real economic subject and a financial institute (a bank, for example) with a big economic availability. At this purpose, we examine an interaction between the above economic subjects: the Enterprise, our first player, and the Financial Institute, our second player. The unique solution which allows both players to win something, and therefore the only one collectively desirable, is represented by an agreement between the two subjects. So the Enterprise artificially causes an inconsistency between spot and future markets, and the Financial Institute takes the opportunity to win the maximum possible collective (social) sum, which later will be divided with the Enterprise by contract. In fact, the Financial Institute is unable to make arbitrages alone because of the introduction, by the normative authority, of an economic transactions tax (that we propose to stabilize the financial market, in order to protect it from speculations). We propose hereunder two kinds of agreement: a fair transferable utility agreement on the initial interaction and a same type of compromise in a coopetitive context. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Historic cases of slightly contaminated soils are managed in a sustainable way by re-use of soil material within a region on the basis of risk-based and land use specific Maximal Values and Background Values. In case of serious soil contamination remediation is in principle necessary and the urgency of remediation has to be determined based on site-specific risks for human health, the ecosystem and groundwater.The major risk assessment tools in The Netherlands are the CSOIL exposure model (human health risks and food safety), Species Sensitivity Distributions and the Soil Quality Triad (ecological risks), along with a procedure to assess the risks due to contaminant spreading to and in the groundwater.Following the principle 'simple if possible, complex when necessary', tiered approaches are used. Contaminated site practices are supported with web-based decision support systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

A key issue affecting these interactions is the lack of control on how data is going to be used and processed by the entities that share it. To partially solve the issue, parties may have defined a set of data sharing policies regulating the exchange of data they own, or over which they have jurisdiction. However, distinct set of policies, defined by different authorities, may lead to conflicts once enacted, since, e.g., different subjects may have defined different permissions on the same data set. This paper focuses on policy analysis and offers a formal support for coming up with a conflict-free set of data sharing policies.

	abstract = {Risk aversion is one of the most important issues in water resources management which may become more complex with existence of uncertainty. To deal with this kind of problems, a novel risk programming model, CNTPS-CRI, was proposed in this paper. It was formulated through integrating two models: CVaR-based nonlinear stochastic programming model (CNTSP), and comprehensive risk index (CRI). The CNTSP is formulated through integrating a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) model into a two-stage stochastic programming (TSP) framework. It could be used to analyze pro-defined policy scenarios and deal with random uncertainties. Moreover, measurement of extreme expected loss on the second-stage penalty cost was incorporated into the model constraints, such that the trade-off between system economy and extreme expected loss could be accounted for. And the nonlinear penalty function avoid the situation that single water users to undertake most of expected risk loss. To help decision maker to choose a suitable risk-aversion alternatives among obtained solutions, the CRI is employed consequently. The developed CNTPS-CRI was applied to a water resources allocation problem. The results demonstrated that the proposed model could help decision makers obtain effective and reasonable allocation alternatives, and make a reasonable decision. ©2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) is an architecture of software design suitable for changing environment, in which the difficulty in the sharing of data and operations. In this paper a SOA-based decision support system (DSS) was built for assessing the short-term risk of storm disaster at coastal area of Shanghai. This was done by integrating a hydrodynamic model and a disaster assessment model into geographical information system (ArcGIS Server 9.3) as a web service using ArcObjects in ArcGIS and Java. Storm flood was simulated by hydrodynamic model at the Yangtze estuary. Population, house area, important units and submerge water depth were considered as impact factors to build storm-tide evaluation index system, with which the influence of storm flood was acquired by quantitative evaluation model using fuzzy method. Geographic information system was investigated to show storm flood process and disaster assessment results in two and three dimension map. According to the assessment results, Optimization Algorithm was employed to calculate afflicted population assigned to available refugee settlements. And optimal retreat routes were provided by Shortest Path Algorithm according to the traffic information of Shanghai. To meet the business demands, the two algorithms were published as web services and integrated into DSS through web services composition(WSC). With the support for 3D geospatial visualization capabilities of Skyline software, this system can provide convenient interfaces for rendering the output in 3D display. The results show that SOA is an effective way to solve information isolated island, integrate heterogeneous computing systems and realize data and services sharing. The system demonstrates the feasibility of implementing information systems that are interoperable, low-cost, web-based, and which have a high evolution capacity through web services. This DSS can help disaster prevention department to analyze and visualize (charts, maps) the possible effects of storm events on both the immediate and long-term risks of flood damage at different regional level, which supplied convenient approach for making scientific policy decision of the flood control and disaster alleviation.},

Currently, the way such changes are made often has a significant impact on the organization's security, productivity, and employee satisfaction. Those who have to make the decisions are put on the spot, and depending on their perspective and circumstances, the decision is biased towards business or security interests. A decision support system for access control policies could mitigate these problems, but to be effective, such a system needs a significant amount of information about specific security and business risks and benefits, and collecting this information requires significant investment. In this paper, we present a participatory approach to collecting this information, which not only reduces cost, but increases effectiveness because it ensures that specific local knowledge and downstream risks are represented and visible to decision-makers. We evaluated our systematically developed decision-support prototype in formative evaluations with employees and decision-makers from a variety of backgrounds. We found that, among others, decision support is highly dependent on the organizational context and that the collected factors need to be contextualized for the contributing individuals. © 2012 ACM.},

One of the major challenge of off-policy learning is to derive counterfactual estimators that also has low variance and thus low generalization error. In this work, inspired by learning bounds for importance sampling prob-. lems, we present a new counterfactual learning principle for off-policy learning with bandit feedbacks. Our method regularizes the generalization error by minimizing the distribution divergence between the logging policy and the new policy, and removes the need for iterating through all training samples to compute sample variance regularization in prior work. With neural network policies, our end-to-end training algorithms using variational divergence minimization showed significant improvement over conventional baseline algorithms and is also consistent with our theoretical results. © 35th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2018.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Economic assessment and verification of large-scaled projects like construction of expressway are most important because they need great amount of budget. For this purpose, decision support system containing all aspects influenced the project is needed and should be carried out before executing the project. Since late 1990s, some decision support systems such as preliminary feasibility assessment and total budget management for SOC projects like highway, railway construction have been performed. This kind of decision support system, in special for expressway construction or for emergency management, has been required by Korean government, as well as NGO. Since last few years, Korean Expressway Corporation (KEC) has constructed traffic information and management system, which collects real-time traffic data on expressway. Through the system, KEC could partially support decision-making such major issues. For supporting decision-making process of expressway policies, several components are necessary such as collecting data, monitoring traffics, and travel behaviors of users for analyzing travel demand, and forecasting for the traffics. There are so far a lot of researches on expressway mainly focusing on data collection, traffic monitor, and management respectively, but not integrating all of them. As social, economic, cultural environment which have been the basis on transportation planning are still changing rapidly, the need of rapid decision-making is increasing for appropriate transportation policies. In these circumstances, simplified sketch planning technique which was compressed long-term, multi-level process to some important steps for rapid decision making could be utilized fully in the transportation planning process. This research has performed to focus on formulating decision support system for expressway policies, which contains newly emerging policies such as toll-free road, HOT, and Hi-pass as well as conventional ones like road construction, and maintenance using sketch planning techniques. This research also presents a consistent framework of decision support system integrated with relating decision issues of problem identification, policy setting, solution methodology, execution, and monitoring.},

Many genetically modified maize varieties contain toxins that target insects, reducing insecticide applications with positive ecological and human health consequences. Crop monitoring is required by US law to manage the development of insect resistance. To assess the onset of resistance, a proactive monitoring system must be able to identify maize infestation across the broad agricultural landscape. Non-destructive monitoring tools are necessary at a scale and definition required to discern insect infestation effects. A joint USEPA and NASA hyperspectral imagery and decision support system project has been successfully evaluated for its ability to distinguish insect infestations in several locations.},

Due to the difficulty of reasoning about such likelihoods and consequences, a computational framework is needed to quantify and bound the risk of violating scheduling requirements. This work addresses the chance-constrained scheduling problem, where actions' durations are modeled probabilistically. Our solution method uses conflict-directed risk allocation to efficiently compute a scheduling policy. The key insight, compared to previous work in probabilistic scheduling, is to decouple the reasoning about temporal and risk constraints. This decomposes the problem into a separate master and subproblem, which can be iteratively solved much quicker. Through a set of simulated car-sharing scenarios, it is empirically shown that conflict-directed risk allocation computes solutions nearly an order of magnitude faster than prior art does, which considers all constraints in a single lump-sum optimization. © Copyright 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

We proposed an agent-based simulation model to address these issues and to study the relationships between the design of an ACO model and its outcomes. Our model includes two types of interacting agents: provider agent and patient agent. The provider agent would respond to the ACO model by changing its behaviors. The patient agent can transition between different health states and thus generate varying demand for healthcare. The individual agent behaviors and their interactions with other agents can affect the aggregated outcomes such as overall healthcare costs and quality. This model can serve as a tool for decision makers to test different policy designs and scenarios to understand the complexity and mitigate the risks involved with this new approach. It can also help devise new healthcare delivery and payment models by optimizing and evaluating model parameters for given policy objectives.},

We propose a computational approach for increasing users' engagement in such settings that is based on optimizing policies for displaying motivational messages to users. The approach, which we refer to as Trajectory Corrected Intervention (TCI), reasons about the tradeoff between the long-term influence of engagement messages on participants' contributions and the potential risk of disrupting their current work. We combine model-based reinforcement learning with off-line policy evaluation to generate intervention policies, without relying on a fixed representation of the domain. TCI works iteratively to learn the best representation from a set of random intervention trials and to generate candidate intervention policies. It is able to refine selected policies off-line by exploiting the fact that users can only be interrupted once per session. We implemented TCI in the wild with Galaxy Zoo, one of the largest citizen science platforms on the web. We found that TCI was able to outperform the state-of-the-art intervention policy for this domain, and significantly increased the contributions of thousands of users. This work demonstrates the benefit of combining traditional AI planning with off-line policy methods to generate intelligent intervention strategies.

We gathered both qualitative and quantitative information through questionnaires and interviews to benchmark these changes. We used an interactive project lifecycle risk management tool developed for NASA mission spaceflight design and quality assurance (DDP - Defect Detection and Prevention) to do this. In this case, we used it to (1) quantify the change in DSS Objectives attained after assimilation of new products, and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of various Mitigation options against potential Risks. The change in Objectives attainment was considered the most important benchmarking indicator for examining the effectiveness of the assimilation of NASA products into OGA/IPAD's DSS. From this research emerged a novel model for benchmarking DSSs that (1) promotes continuity and synergy within and between government agencies, (2) accommodates scientific, operational and architectural dynamics, and (3) facilitates transfer of knowledge among research, management, and decision-making agencies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In this paper we review progress towards the implementation of a risk management framework for US federal wildland fire policy and operations. We first describe new developments in wildfire simulation technology that catalyzed the development of risk-based decision support systems for strategic wildfire management. These systems include new analytical methods to measure wildfire risk to human and ecological values and to inform fuel treatment investment strategies at national, regional, and local scales. Application of the risk management framework to support wildfire incidents has been dramatically advanced with the Wildland Fire Decision Support System and allowed policy modifications that encourage management of incidents for multiple objectives. The new wildfire risk management decision support systems we discuss provide Federal agencies in the US the ability to integrate risk-informed approaches to a wide range of wildfire management responsibilities and decisions. While much progress has been made, there remain several barriers that need to be addressed to fully integrate risk science into current wildfire management practices. We conclude by identifying five primary issues that if properly addressed could help public land management better realize the opportunities and potential payoffs from fully adopting a risk management paradigm. © 2011.},

Six features were selected as the inputs of the decision trees including age, sex, annual income, educational level, occupation, and risk preference. Three hundred insurants from an insurance company in Taiwan were used as examples for establishing the decision models. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the decision trees. The first one used the purchase records of primary insurances as examples. The second one used the purchase records of primary insurances and additional insurances. Each experiment contained four rounds according to different partitions of training sets and test sets.

	abstract = {Engagement with farmers and landowners is often undertaken by the research community to obtain information relating to typical land, livestock and enterprise management and generally centres on responses to questionnaire surveys. Farmers and land managers are constituted as expert observers of ground-level processes and provide diverse information on farming practices, enterprise economics and underpinning attitudes towards risk. Research projects designed to inform policy and practice may rely on such data to understand better on-the-ground decisions that can impact on environmental quality and the rural economy. Such approaches to eliciting local-level expert knowledge can generate large quantities of data from which to formulate rules relating to farm enterprise types. In turn, this can help to inform the structure of Decision Support Systems (DSS) and risk-based tools to determine farming practices likely to impact on environmental quality. However, in this paper we advocate the need for integrated farmer participation throughout the whole research process - from project inception through to community qualitative validation and legitimation - and thus not just for the elicitation of questionnaire responses. With farm questionnaire surveys being adopted widely by the research community, it is an opportune time to highlight a recent case study of the Taw catchment, Devon, UK. This serves as an example of co-construction of a DSS via a co-ordinated and integrated approach to expert elicitation with a farmer questionnaire survey as a central methodology. The aim of the paper is to detail the core aspects of an iterative cycle of participatory environmental management and DSS development for water quality protection and consider the multiple benefits of co-ordinated programmes of engagement with the farming community in this process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of Plant Incorporated Protectant (PIP) maize by American producers has been increasing dramatically. PIP maize contains genetically inserted traits that produce toxins in the plant that provide narrowly targeted protection against specific insect pests. The plant producing toxins can offer significant reductions in the application of broad-spectrum pesticides that have ecological and human health consequences. PIP maize as a percentage of total maize acreage planted in the US is expected to continue to increase as these protective traits are a"stackeda" with other desirable traits by seed companies, and producers are seeing considerable increases in yield as a result [1]. The introduction of maize as a bio-fuel source for ethanol has increased production by over 6 million hectares in 2007 [2]. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), which is responsible for the registration of PIP crops under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, views the use of PIP maize as positive. Broad spectrum pesticide use has declined since the PIP traits have been introduced. As the agricultural landscape sees a higher percentage of maize acres using the PIP echnology, the risk of the targeted insect pest populations developing resistance to the toxins, thereby rendering them useless will increase as well [3]. This result would negate the effectiveness of the PIP maize traits and could reduce production of a US field maize crop valued at $33 billion dollars in 2006 and place US food and now energy security at risk [4]. Management simulation models are combined with NASA remote sensing products to monitor the maize landscape for resistance development. The two agencies have entered into an agreement which could potentially lead to the development of next generation NASA sensors that will more specifically address the requirements of the USEPA's resistance development strategy. The USEPA/NASA team has developed a broad research program entitled CERES (Crop Evaluation Research for Environmental Strategies). CERES is a research effort leading to decision support system tools that are designed to integrate multi-resolution NASA remote sensing data products and USEPA geospatial models to monitor the potential for insect pest resistance development from the regional to the landscape and then to the field level. At the current stage of development, CERES consists of three tiers. Space-based sensors are expected to provide area wide surveillance, airborne sensors are tasked with the monitoring of local conditions and in-field inspection teams provide the final discernment of insect pest resistance development. USEPA will use the information provided by CERES in developing resistance strategies and required monitoring. Eventually, CERES can be made available via the internet to seed producers, agricultural growers, government and academia to allow each group to monitor and report resistance as it occurs to ensure the continued, effective use of the PIP technologies and the security of the American food and fuel supply. © 2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Computational social science, as with all complex adaptive systems sciences, involves a great amount of uncertainty on several fronts, including intrinsic arbitrariness such as that due to path dependence, disagreement on social theory and how to capture it in software, input data of different credibility that does not exactly match the requirements of software because it was gathered for another purpose, and inexactly matching translations between models that were designed for different purposes than the study at hand. This paper presents a method of formally tracking that uncertainty, keeping the data input parameters proportionate with logical and probabilistic constraints, and capturing proportionate dynamics of the output ordered by the decision points of policy change, for the purpose of risk-based analysis. Once ordered this way, the data can be compared to other data similarly expressed, whether that data is from simulation excursions or from the real world, for objective comparison and distance scoring at the level of dynamic patterns as opposed to single outcome validation. This method enables wargame adjudicators to be run out with data gleaned from the wargame, enables data to be repurposed for both training and testing set, and facilitates objective validation scoring through soft matching. Artificial intelligence tools used in the method include probabilistic ontologies with crisp and Bayesian inference, game trees that are multiplayer non-zero sum and decision point based rather than turn-based, and Markov processes to represent the dynamic data and align the models for objective comparison.

	abstract = {This study proposed a novel hybrid artificial intelligence (HAI) model that integrated the unique advantages of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique with borderline schema (Borderline-SMOTE), fuzzy rough set theory (FRST), and support vector machine (SVM), in order to predict the default probability of non-profit financial institutes (credit unions) under an imbalanced data structure. We utilized Borderline-SMOTE to overcome the class imbalance problem and employ FRST to select the important features of credit unions, feeding these representative characteristics into SVM to construct the risk assessment model. The result showed that no specific risk assessment model presented the best performance under different criteria and dissimilar environment factors. Thus, we handled model selection through a statistical examination that systematically determined a more appropriate one. The study further tackled the obscure nature of the SVM-based hybrid model and generated interpretable rules, which helped develop an interactive rule format so that decision makers can use condition attributes to predict the status of credit unions, as well as to follow the model's directions to improve their organization's capital structure. Finally, the study compared the ex-ante and ex-post decision rules established in relation to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. The comparison could be useful for central bank governors in assessing policy implications and in formulating future policy that will ensure stability in a credit union environment.

	abstract = {This study focuses on the potential role of technical and institutional innovations for improving water management in a multi-user context in Burkina Faso. We focus on a system centered on three reservoirs that capture the waters of the Upper Comoé River Basin and servicing a diversity of users, including a sugar manufacturing company, a urban water supply utility, a farmer cooperative, and other downstream users. Due to variable and declining rainfall and expanding users' needs, drastic fluctuations in water supply and demand occur during each dry season. A decision support tool was developed through participatory research to enable users to assess the impact of alternative release and diversion schedules on deficits faced by each user. The tool is meant to be applied in the context of consultative planning by a local user committee that has been created by a new national integrated water management policy. We contend that both solid science and good governance are instrumental in realizing efficient and equitable water management and adaptation to climate variability and change. But, while modeling tools and negotiation platforms may assist users in managing climate risk, they also introduce additional uncertainties into the deliberative process. It is therefore imperative to understand how these technological and institutional innovations frame water use issues and decisions to ensure that such framing is consistent with the goals of integrated water resource management. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Although it has one of the largest integrated power generation, transmission and distribution systems in the world, Brazil still faces difficulties in consolidating the various technologies that make up Smart Grids solutions and in executing large projects in the sector, especially in distribution management. Currently, some utilities have pilot projects in operation in a small number of cities, but these projects face several obstacles in the technical, economic, political and legal areas. This study analyses the receptivity to the Smart Grid technologies in the Brazilian electric sector context, by the application of a framework that allows: (i) to identify the obstacles to the implementation of Smart Grid projects and (ii) to propose recommendations for innovation policies. Considering that the Smart Grids solution are composed by a wide gamma of technologies, thus study initially examined the whole smart grid solution, and then focused on an important technology: Advanced Distribution Management Software (ADMS). The chosen framework adopts the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) concept, that maps the functional pattern of a TIS, allowing the evaluation of its development stage through the identification of the strategic points relevant to its growth. As a final product of the application of the framework, policy recommendations can be proposed to foster the development of research, projects, formation of national companies, implementation and diffusion of knowledge of smart grids technologies in Brazil. Many blocking mechanisms to be faced were identified, such as obsolete regulation contracts; unfavorable tributary environment; bottlenecks in the R&D network formation; high macroeconomic instability in the last years, causing uncertainty and increasing the risk perception; high cost of the smart grids solutions and ADMS, specifically, and lack of good results on smart grid researches. To leverage smart grid projects, the policy recommendations include, among others: specific short-term actions, firstly conferring a new model of regulation of the electric system that allows distributors to make investments. In the medium term, it is necessary to perform a reform of taxes and the way in which services and software licenses are imported. In the long term it is necessary to invest in education and research, stimulating the partnership between agencies, companies, universities, institutes and research centers. The strengthening of this network is fundamental for the development of R&D in Brazil. As a conclusion of this research, it can be said that Brazil has a weak functional pattern combined with specific blocking mechanisms that weaken the Technological System and hamper the development and implementation of Smart Grids technologies. © 2018 Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018.

These methods are not yet as familiar to many risk analysts as older statistical and model-based methods, such as the paradigm of identifying a single "best-fitting" model and performing sensitivity analyses for its conclusions. They provide genuine breakthroughs for improving predictions and decisions when the correct model is highly uncertain.

	abstract = {Land degradation in term of soil erosion is the single most important environmental concern in the developing countries. Eroded sediment also acts as both a physical and chemical pollutant. It has been become an ecological, social and economic problem. This study explored the influence of major socioeconomic factors on erosion processes and conservation measures in a Dry Zone farming context for producing Erosion Risk Map of the study area. We also put forward a way of studying soil Erosion and relations of soil erosion factors by integrated GIS and RS. Knowing extent and severity of the land is important as a decision support system to policy makers, resource managers as well as local communities and farmers. Firstly, satellite images (ETM) and the ground real conditions have been rectified. Secondly, according to the ecological environmental factors, the spatial database and Digital Elevation Model of the study area have been built. Finally, referring to Universal Soil Loss Equation, the quantization and distribution of the soil erosion, risks and changes have been obtained. The result of this assessment showed spatial distribution of different land degradation severity across the area in watershed basis. Soil erosion susceptibility was estimated through Universal Soil Loss Equation USLE. To examine land potential, land capability classification was carried out using Storie Index Rating SIR. Population density was included in the model since human pressures on the land was considered as a major contribution factor for land degradation. Soil erosion, land capability and population density parameters were modeled in GIS platform. Though modeling of land degradation assessment is specific and involving much basic information such as suitability of crops, soil fertility, social and environment benefits etc., this study was only intend to develop a model based on spatial information and demographic data.},

	abstract = {Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a theory of data analysis that identifies conceptual structures among datasets. A strong feature of FCA is its capability of producing graphical visualizations of the inherent structures among data. High-risk systems have some special characteristics that result in inevitable accidents. This research utilizes FCA to investigate vessel accidents on the lower Mississippi river. FCA identifies the concepts that are vital indicators of a special type of accident, a collision. It is possible to analyze navigation environments and thereby gain a better understanding of these accidents. Such accidents may not be completely eliminated, though it is beneficial to identify when they were most likely to occur and take appropriate control measures. Furthermore, identification of the most dangerous environments might suggest specific safety regimens and regulatory control designs. The FCA suggests three groups of policy decisions, representing a series of increasingly dangerous situations for vessel traffic in a treacherous inland waterway. The three groups are made of: two sets of "cautionary" conditions, three sets of "serious" conditions, and one set for "prohibitive" action, respectively. The FCA does not make decisions; it clearly identifies distinct environments that require guidelines (i.e. regimens) for safe navigation to lessen or eliminate normal or system accidents.},

	abstract = {To help clinicians care for patients with HIV infection, we developed an interactive knowledge-based electronic patient record that integrates rule-based decision support and full-text information retrieval with an online patient record. This highly interactive clinical workstation now allows the clinicians at a large primary care practice (30,000 ambulatory visits per year) to use online information resources and fully electronic patient records during all patient encounters. The resulting practice database is continually updated with outcome data on a cohort of 700 patients with HIV infection. As a byproduct of this integrated system, we have developed improved statistical methods to measure the effects of electronic alerts and reminders.},

	abstract = {Current approaches to technology management express the need to manage technology systematically from both strategic and operational perspectives. However, considerable ambiguity seems to prevail over the exact way of managing it. This paper presents an object-oriented intelligent management system for technology management by using the methodology of Intelligent Engineering. A hierarchical model is proposed to manage the complex and ill-formulated technology management process. The design and implementation for the Intelligent Management System for Technology Management (IMS-TM) using the hierarchical model are described. A meta-system, which serves as IMS-TM kernel to manage and control the operation of the systems, is presented. This intelligent management system framework has been implemented in a government technology supervision bureau to assist the management of their technology development policy and project management.},
